# Okta Developer Site

The [Okta developer site][doc] serves Okta's API documentation and guides, including:
- [API references](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/)
- [SDK references and sample code](https://developer.okta.com/documentation/)
- [Authentication quickstarts](https://developer.okta.com/quickstart/)
- [Developer Blog](https://developer.okta.com/blog/) (not published from this repo, see [https://github.com/okta/okta.github.io](okta/okta.github.io))

If you have questions or need help with Okta's APIs or SDKs, visit the **[Developer Forum][devforum]**. You can also email developers@okta.com to create a support ticket.

## Getting Started
Okta's developer documentation (this repo) is built using the [VuePress][vuepress] site generator.
There are currently 2 parts to the site, the content and the theming/plugins.

### Requirements
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): 8+
 - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable): 1.7+

Before getting started, open a terminal window and make sure these commands work:

```sh
node --version

yarn --version
```

### Local setup
 1. Fork this repository
 2. Clone (use the **Clone or download** button above)

3. Install the dependencies with `yarn`:

```sh
cd okta-developer-docs

yarn install
```

This will install everything you need to build the documentation on your machine.

### Previewing the site

With the above steps completed, you can start a preview server by running this command inside the cloned directory:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts a preview server on your machine, and watches all files for changes. Open http://localhost:8080/documentation/ to view the documentation.

 > Note: if you try to visit the root, you will get a 404 page.  You must visit a path corresponding to a [directory under `vuepress-site`](https://github.com/okta/okta-developer-docs/tree/master/packages/%40okta/vuepress-site), like `/documentation`.

The preview server supports hot reloading. Once the server is running on your machine, any changes you make to Markdown content will appear automatically in your browser within a few seconds. Note that changes to page frontmatter or site configuration require you to stop and start the preview server.

## Adding and editing pages

Documentation pages are stored as Markdown files in the `/packages/@okta/vuepress-site` directory.

As an example, lets say you want to edit the [Users API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/users) page. The public path of this page is `/docs/api/resources/users/`.
To edit this page, you would navigate to `/packages/@okta/vuepress-site/docs/api/resources/users/index.md` and edit that Markdown file.

An `index.md` file in a directory like `users` will be served as `/users/` when the site is live. If you name the file anything other than `index.md`, you will need to include `.html` in the URL when you view the page in your browser.

More information about writing content for VuePress can be found in our [VuePress Authoring Guidelines](https://github.com/okta/okta-developer-docs/wiki/VuePress-Authoring-Guidelines). There you will also find our [Style Guide](https://github.com/okta/okta-developer-docs/wiki/Style-Guide).

### What About Building the Site Before Committing?
There is no need to build the rendered site before committing and submitting a PR. This will all happen on the CI side to test and build the rendered site.

## Running tests
Running the tests before committing should be done and can be accomplished by running `yarn test` from the terminal. This will run a series of tests to make sure that everything is working as expected and that your changes did not affect anything that was not planned.

> Note: If you're already running the preview server locally, you can run `yarn test-only` instead. This skips starting up the preview server.

If your test run fails unexpectedly, try executing `yarn stop` and running the tests again.

## Theme and Plugin Contribution
The theme and plugins are in separate packages from content. All of the theme files live in `/packages/@okta/vuepress-theme-default` â€“ see that package's readme for more info.
