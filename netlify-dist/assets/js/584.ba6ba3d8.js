For example, 192.168.0.0/16 would allow any IP address between 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.255.255. The rule rejects any IP address outside that range.

At the software level, it's essential to have a limit on the number of concurrent calls available to a specific customer. Giving users strictly defined limits on concurrent requests or total requests over a given duration (50 requests per minute) can be an excellent way to reject traffic and maintain service stability. The rate limit is usually tied to the customer's plan or payment level. For example, customers on a free plan may only get 1,000 API calls, whereas customers at the premium level may get 10,000 API calls.
