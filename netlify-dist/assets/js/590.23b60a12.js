The system was complex and the problems we were solving were genuinely interesting and intellectually gratifying. And because of our customer, keeping the system and its users secure was of the utmost importance. I went from being somewhat naive about how applications were secured to being thrust into a team that was responsible for securing one of the most important computer systems in the country given events at the time.
