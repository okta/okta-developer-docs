### PKCE for Browser Clients, CORS Headers for OAuth 2 Token Endpoint

Okta now supports Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for browser clients and returns CORS headers on the OAuth 2.0 Token endpoints.

### Bugs Fixed in 2019.03.2

* Under some circumstances, users in a locked out state would receive success responses from the SMS recovery API. (OKTA-207288)
* In some instances, users who were not Okta-mastered would have inaccurate `passwordChanged` values in API responses. (OKTA-210233)
* SAML applications created through the API would not save the value for the `HonorForceAuthn` property. (OKTA-209083)
* For SAML applications, the `attributeStatements` object would not update if a `null` value was passed as part of a PUT operation. (OKTA-209767)
