### Token Inline Hook Can Modify Sub-Objects and Array Elements

The [Token Inline Hook](/docs/reference/token-hook/) now lets you modify particular sub-objects or array elements within objects contained in claims, without needing to update the rest of the object. <!-- OKTA-227364 -->

### Bugs Fixed in 2019.06.3

* When a customer used a [Token Inline Hook](/docs/reference/token-hook/) and returned an `error` object to Okta, Okta failed to pass the error to the token requester. (OKTA-231397)

* The issuer claim inside JWT tokens was erroneously changing to all lowercase causing JWT verification failure when the application was case-sensitive. (OKTA-235710)

* When a customer called the `POST /idps/credentials/keys` endpoint and supplied an `x5t#S256` parameter to specify the SHA-256 thumbprint of the certificate that they were adding, Okta failed to validate the thumbprint.
