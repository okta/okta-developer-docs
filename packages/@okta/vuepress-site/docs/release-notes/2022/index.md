#### Improved email magic link authentication experience is EA in Preview

Email magic links are enhanced to allow end users to authenticate in two different contexts. They can authenticate using the same location where they click the link and quickly return to the application context. Or, if the end user clicks the link in a different browser, they can enter a one-time password to proceed with authentication. See [Sign in with password and email factors](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-pwd-email/) and [Use redirect auth with the Identity Engine sample apps](/docs/guides/sampleapp-oie-redirectauth/).

#### Splunk available for Log Streaming is EA in Preview

Many organizations use third-party systems to monitor, aggregate, and act on the event data in Okta System Log events.

Log Streaming enables Okta admins to more easily and securely send System Log events to a specified system such as the Splunk Cloud in near real time with simple, pre-built connectors. Log streaming scales well even with high event volume, and unlike many existing System Log event collectors, it does not require a third-party system to store an Okta Admin API token. See [Splunk Cloud in the Log Streaming API](/docs/reference/api/log-streaming/#splunk-cloud-settings-object).

#### Burst rate limits available on Rate Limit Dashboard

The rate limit dashboard, available from the Admin Console, now includes data on burst limits in your Okta org, in addition to rate limit warnings and violations. The Violations dashboard was renamed Events to acknowledge the increase of scope, and includes the ability to filter on timeline as well as the type of event (warning, burst, and violation). Hovering over the burst rates in the graphs provides more detail and links to the system log for individual endpoint calls. The individual Usage graphs provide details on bursts for the individual API. See [Rate limit dashboard](/docs/reference/rl-dashboard/) and [Burst rate limits](/docs/reference/rate-limits/#burst-rate-limits).

#### Signed request support for generic OIDC IdP is GA in Preview

When customers [integrate Okta with an OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta), Okta asks the IdP to authenticate the user with request elements that are passed as query parameters in the URL. The new [Signed Request Object](/docs/reference/api/idps/#oidc-algorithms-object) allows customers to send these parameters encoded in a JWT instead, improving security on the authorization request sent to the OpenID Connect provider or authorization server.

#### Client secret rotation and key management is GA in Preview

Rotating client secrets without service or application downtime is a challenge. Additionally, JSON Web Key management can be cumbersome. To make [client secret rotation](/docs/guides/client-secret-rotation-key/) a seamless process and improve JWK management, you can now create overlapping client secrets and manage JWK key pairs in the Admin Console. You can also create JWK key pairs from the Admin Console without having to use an external tool.

#### Okta Org2Org integration supporting Okta API access using an OAuth 2.0 client is GA in Preview

The Okta Org2Org integration enables you to push and match both users and groups from one Okta org to another. Previously, this integration only supported token-based access to the Okta API. You can now [configure the Org2Org integration](/docs/guides/secure-oauth-between-orgs/) to access the Okta API as an [OAuth 2.0 client](/docs/reference/api/apps/#token-based-provisioning-connection-profile-properties). This increases security by limiting the scope of access and providing a better mechanism to rotate credentials.

#### Bug fixed in 2022.04.0

Performing a POST request on the `/apps/{applicationId}` [endpoint](/docs/reference/api/apps/#update-application) didn't update the secret if the org had the [Client Credentials Management](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#client-credentials-flow) feature enabled. (OKTA-482341)

| [Bug fixed in 2022.03.1](#bug-fixed-in-2022-03-1) | March 09, 2022 |

#### Bug fixed in 2022.03.1

When the [List email templates](/docs/reference/api/brands/#list-email-templates) or the [List email customizations](/docs/reference/api/brands/#list-email-customizations) operations were performed on the `/brands/` endpoint, the base address in the link response header contained the `-admin` string instead of the requested base address. (OKTA-465356)

### Monthly release 2022.03.0

#### Authentication timestamp is added as an access token claim

The user-authenticated epoch timestamp is provided as the `auth_time` [claim in the access token](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#reserved-claims-in-the-payload-section).

#### Custom Administrator Roles is GA in Production

The Okta [Custom Administrator Roles](/docs/reference/api/roles/) API provides operations that you can use to create customized roles and assign them to a user or a group.

#### Email Address Bounces API is EA in Preview

Okta admins can now control the bounced email address list through the [Email Address Bounces API](/docs/reference/api/org/#email-address-bounces-operations). When Okta-sent email addresses are blocked from an email service (the bounced email list), admins can use this API to create a list of blocked email addresses to be removed from the email service.

#### Enhanced email macros for email template customization

Enhanced Email Macros updates the email templating engine to use Velocity Templating Language (VTL). This feature unlocks new syntax that provides enhanced conditional logic and access to all attributes in the Okta User Profile object. This allows developers and admins more customizations in their user-facing emails. See [Customize email notifications > Use Velocity Templating Language](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#use-velocity-templating-language) and [Customize an email template](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Settings_Email).

#### Signed request support for generic OIDC IdP is EA in Preview

When customers [integrate Okta with an OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta), Okta asks the IdP to authenticate the user with request elements that are passed as query parameters in the URL. The new [Signed Request Object](/docs/reference/api/idps/#oidc-algorithms-object) allows customers to send these parameters encoded in a JWT instead, improving security on the authorization request sent to the OpenID Connect provider or authorization server.

#### Bugs fixed in 2022.03.0

* The admin app assignment event wasn't triggered for an individual admin role assignment. (OKTA-460521)

* When ThreatInsight evaluated sign-in attempts for unknown users, the threat level was incorrectly displayed as `threatLevel=UNKNOWN` in the System Log. (OKTA-471299)

* The OAuth 2.0 [`/token`](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#token) and [`/authorize`](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#authorize) endpoints accepted requests that included the `resource` parameter. (OKTA-476549)

#### API token ID added to System Log event types

API requests that include an API token and return a System Log event now include the API token in the event payload. The token identifier appears in the System Log API `transaction.details.requestApiTokenId` field and in the `Event > System > Transaction > Detail > RequestApiTokenId` node in the Admin Console System Log. <!--OKTA-463678-->

To view an example of this new event detail, [create a user by API](/docs/guides/quickstart/main/#create-a-user-by-api) and view the associated event (`user.lifecycle.create`).

#### Bug fixed in 2022.02.1

The [OAuth token endpoint](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#response-example-error-2) didn’t reject requests that included a `code_verifier` parameter if the [authorization call](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#authorize) was issued without the PKCE `code_challenge` parameter. (OKTA-461970)

#### Custom Administrator Roles is GA in Preview

The Okta [Custom Administrator Roles](/docs/reference/api/roles/) API provides operations that you can use to create customized roles and assign them to a user or a group. <!--OKTA-457514-->

#### Client secret rotation and key management is EA

Rotating client secrets without service or application downtime is a challenge. Additionally, JSON Web Key management can be cumbersome.

You can also create JWK key pairs from the Admin Console without having to use an external tool. <!--OKTA-460699-->

#### Group role assignment improvement

[Assigning a role to a group](/docs/reference/api/roles/#assign-a-role-to-a-group) through the Administrator Roles API has been enhanced by retaining the existing role assignment ID where possible. <!--OKTA-457506-->

#### Custom application username formats that allow the word "source" is GA in Production

Custom application username formats that are set by the [Apps API](/docs/reference/api/apps/) can now include the word "source." <!--OKTA-443207-->

#### Custom Domains with Okta-Managed Certificates is GA in Production

When you customize an Okta URL domain, your Okta-hosted pages are branded with your own URL. [Okta-Managed Certificates](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/main/#configure-a-custom-domain-through-okta-managed-certificates) auto renew through a Let's Encrypt integration, a free certificate authority. Since Okta handles certificate renewals, this reduces customer developer maintenance costs and the high risk of a site outage when certificates expire.  <!--OKTA-459338-->

#### Bug fixed in 2022.02.0

In the [Custom Administrator Roles](/docs/reference/api/roles/) API, some public DELETE requests returned a different response code than their contract. (OKTA-456896)

The masking algorithm now reveals fewer digits in API responses for shorter profile phone numbers. <!--OKTA-455393-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2022.01.2

* When an invalid client assertion type was provided during a [Client Credentials grant type flow](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/), the error response code was 401 instead of 400. (OKTA-456503)

* When the [Create a new Binding](/docs/reference/api/roles/#create-a-new-binding) or the [Add more Members to a Binding](/docs/reference/api/roles/#add-more-members-to-a-binding) operation was performed on the `/iam/resource-sets` endpoint, and included all users or all groups in the request, the request didn't fail as expected. (OKTA-459994)

#### Bugs fixed in 2022.01.1

* If the [Create a Scope](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/#create-a-scope) endpoint received multiple requests at or near the same time, duplicate Scopes could be created. (OKTA-442533)

* When the [Update resource set](/docs/reference/api/roles/#update-resource-set) endpoint was called, the `resourceSetId` parameter was required in the body of the request. (OKTA-445144)

* When the [Upload Theme background image](/docs/reference/api/brands/#upload-theme-background-image) endpoint was called, the image was converted to PNG format. (OKTA-458260)

* When the [List events](/docs/reference/api/system-log/#list-events) operation was performed on the `/logs` endpoint, some system logs showed the incorrect status for debug behaviors if there was missing data that prevented behavior evaluation. (OKTA-455372)

### Monthly release 2022.01.0

| Change                                                                   | Expected in Preview Orgs |

| [Error response updated for malicious IP address sign-in requests is GA in Production](#error-response-updated-for-malicious-ip-address-sign-in-requests-is-ga-in-production) | December 8, 2021 |

| [New permissions for custom admin roles](#new-permissions-for-custom-admin-roles) | January 6, 2022|

#### Error response updated for malicious IP address sign-in requests is GA in Production

If you block suspicious traffic and [ThreatInsight](/docs/reference/api/threat-insight/) detects that the sign-in request comes from a malicious IP address, Okta automatically denies the user access to the organization. The user receives an error in response to the request. From the user's perspective, the blocked request can't be identified due to ThreatInsight having identified the IP address as malicious. <!--OKTA-454335-->

#### Dynamic Issuer Mode is GA in Production

An authorization server's issuer URL can be used to validate whether tokens are issued by the correct authorization server. You can configure the issuer URL to be either the Okta subdomain (such as `company.okta.com`) or a custom domain (such as `sso.company.com`). See [Property details](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/#authorization-server-properties).

When there are applications that use Okta's subdomain and other applications that use the custom domain, the issuer validation breaks because the value is hard-coded to one domain or the other.

With Dynamic Issuer Mode, the issuer value in minted tokens is dynamically updated based on the URL that is used to initiate the original authorize request. See [Client application settings](/docs/reference/api/apps/#settings-10). <!--OKTA-452668-->

#### Custom domains with Okta-managed certificates is GA in Production

When you customize an Okta URL domain, your Okta-hosted pages are branded with your own URL. [Okta-managed certificates](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/main/#configure-a-custom-domain-through-okta-managed-certificates) automatically renew through a Let's Encrypt integration, a free certificate authority. Okta-managed certificate renewals lower customer developer maintenance costs and reduce the high risk of a site outage when certificates expire. <!--OKTA-437290-->

#### New permissions for custom admin roles

The Administrator Roles API includes new app [permissions](/docs/reference/api/roles/#permission-properties) for custom admin roles to run end-to-end imports. See [About role permissions](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=csh-cstm-admin-role-app-permissions).<!--OKTA-433371-->
