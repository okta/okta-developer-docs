### Added Support for TOTP Factor

Okta now supports a custom MFA factor based on the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm. For more information, see [Custom HOTP Factor](/docs/reference/api/factors/#enroll-custom-hotp-factor). <!-- OKTA-236375 -->

### Cookies updated to preserve cross-site functionality

To preserve cross-site functionality in light of upcoming updates to [Chrome](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592), Okta has added the `SameSite=None` attribute to all relevant cookies. <!-- OKTA-229541 -->

### Inline Hooks is now GA in Preview

[Inline Hooks](/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/) enable you to integrate your own custom functionality into Okta process flows. The framework to support them is now Generally Available (GA) in Preview. <!-- OKTA-241104 -->

### LinkedIn API V2 is now supported 

Okta now supports LinkedIn API V2. Creation of [LinkedIn Identity Providers](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/linkedin/create-an-app-at-idp/) has been re-enabled in all Production orgs. <!-- OKTA-237649 -->

### Mappings API is now GA in Preview

The Okta Mappings API provides operations to manage the mapping of properties between an Okta User's and an App User's
[Profile Properties](/docs/reference/api/users/#profile-object) using [Expression Language](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language). This feature is now GA in Preview. <!-- OKTA-241748 -->

### Missing type property now returns a 400 error code

If you create an [IP network zone](/docs/reference/api/zones/#ip-zone-properties) without a `type` property for an IP field, PUT or POST requests made to the Zone API now return a 400 error code. <!-- OKTA-239170 -->

### Bug Fixed in 2019.08.0

In the Update User API, when the `secondEmail` attribute in a user's profile was updated with an empty value (instead of `null`), the user was incorrectly prompted for `secondEmail`. (OKTA-240382)
