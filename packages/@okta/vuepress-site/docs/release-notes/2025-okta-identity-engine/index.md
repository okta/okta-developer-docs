#### OAuth 2.0 provisioning for Org2Org with Autorotation is self-service EA in Preview

Admins deploying multi-org architectures (for example Okta hub-and-spoke orgs) need to secure user and group provisioning. Provisioning using OAuth2.0 scoped tokens has several advantages over API tokens, including more access granularity, shorter token lifespans, and automatic key rotation. You can now enable OAuth 2.0 Auto-Rotation for Org2Org app provisioning directly from the Admin Console, in addition to the API.

To support these updates, the Application Connections API includes a new endpoint, [Retrieve a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) for the default provisioning connection](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ApplicationConnections/#tag/ApplicationConnections/operation/getUserProvisioningConnectionJWKS), and schema updates to support token autorotation, `rotationMode=AUTO`. See [Update the default provisioning connection](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ApplicationConnections/#tag/ApplicationConnections/operation/updateDefaultProvisioningConnectionForApplication!path=1/profile&t=request) and [Integrate Okta Org2Org with Okta](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-org2org-intg#Use2). <!-- OKTA-903533 FF ORG2ORG_ENABLE_PROVISION_JWK -->

#### Retrieve the SSF Stream status is EA in Preview

Retrieve the SSF Stream status endpoint (`/api/v1/ssf/stream/status`) is now available. The status indicates whether the transmitter is able to transmit events over the stream. This endpoint is available if you have enabled the Enable Managed Apple ID federation and provisioning feature for your org. <!-- OKTA-898183 OKTA_SSF_TRANSMITTER_PUSH -->

#### OIN test account information deleted after 30 days

Okta deletes your test account credentials 30 days after you publish your app in **OIN Wizard**. You must create a new test account and re-enter the required information before submitting the app.

#### Risk Provider and Risk Events APIs are deprecated

These APIs have been deprecated. Use the [SSF Security Event Tokens API]([https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFSecurityEventToken/|https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFSecurityEventToken/]) instead to receive security-related events and other data-subject signals. Use the [SSF Receiver API]([https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/|https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/]) for third-party security event providers. <!-- OKTA-866092 -->

#### POST requests to authorize endpoint is GA Preview

You can now send user data securely in a POST request body to the `/authorize` endpoint. <!-- OKTA-827104 OAUTH2_AUTHORIZE_WITH_POST -->

#### Integration variable limit increase in OIN Submission

The maximum number of integration variables allowed in OIN submission has increased from three to eight. The apps migrated from OIN Manager with more than eight variables can retain all existing variables but can't add new variables.

#### Conditional requests and entity tags are GA in Production

You can now use conditional requests and entity tags to tag and check for specific versions of resources. Currently this is only available to use with user profiles. See [Conditional Requests and Entity Tags](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#conditional-requests-and-entity-tags).  <!-- ETAG_FOR_USERS_API OKTA-822688 -->

#### New rate limit event type

This rate limit event type now appears in the System Log: `system.rate_limit.configuration.update`. It logs the following:

* Changes to client-based rate limit settings
* Changes in the rate limit warning notification threshold
* If the rate limit notification is enabled or disabled
* Updates to the rate-limit percentage of an API token

<!-- OKTA-797466  -->

#### Create dynamic resource sets with conditions is GA in Preview

Resource set conditions help you limit the scope of a role by excluding an admin's access to certain apps. This gives you more granular control over your custom admin roles and helps meet your org's unique security needs. See [Resource set conditions](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=resource-set-conditions) and the corresponding [Resource Set Resources](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RoleCResourceSetResource/) API.
<!-- OKTA-746719 DYNAMIC_RESOURCE_SETS -->

#### Okta account management policy is GA in Production

The Okta account management policy helps admins easily build phishing resistance into actions such as account unlock, password recovery, authenticator enrollment, and profile setting changes. Using the familiar rule-based framework of an authentication policy, admins can now customize which phishing-resistant authenticators are required when users attempt these common self-service actions. All of the configurations in the authentication policies can now be applied for authenticator management. See [Configure an Okta account management policy](/docs/guides/okta-account-management-policy/main/). <!-- AUTH_POLICY_FOR_ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT -->

#### Okta Sign-In Widget custom template updates

Admins can now use the `useSiwGen3` variable in the sign-in page code editor to help with migrations from Gen2 to Gen3 of the Okta Sign-In Widget. See [Use the code editor](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#usesiwgen3).

#### Developer documentation update in 2025.04.0

The [Update a published integration with the OIN Wizard](/docs/guides/update-oin-app/openidconnect/main/) is a newly restructured guide which consists of our existing publish integration content and a brand new [updating the attribute mapping flow](/docs/guides/update-oin-app/scim/main/#configure-attribute-mappingshttps://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/update-oin-app/scim/main/#configure-attribute-mappings) section for SCIM integrations.

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.04.0

* The result of System Log events triggered by the `use_dpop_nonce` OAuth 2.0 error was FAILURE instead of CHALLENGE. (OKTA-902314)

* When the Okta-to-Okta Claims Sharing feature was enabled, users who signed in using ADSSO on a spoke org were prompted for their password in the hub org. (OKTA-897340) (OKTA-897340)

* Admins using multiple user types sometimes encountered an internal error when attempting to update an app instance. (OKTA-880825)

* If an AAGUID key that wasnâ€™t verified by the FIDO Alliance Metadata Service (MDS) was added to an authenticator group, then future PUT requests to `api/v1/authenticators/{authenticatorId}/methods/webauthn` failed. (OKTA-875920) (OKTA-875920)

* The wrong HTTP error code was returned for the SSF stream creation operation when one stream already existed. (OKTA-868972) (OKTA-868972)

* A Policies API GET request (`/api/v1/policies`) returned a `rel="next"` link when there were no more results. (OKTA-858605) (OKTA-858605)

* The OIN Submission Tester didn't support custom domains in the IdP flow. (OKTA-835402) (OKTA-835402)

* When `/api/v1/apps` was called, it returned all applications assigned, even though the user wasn't part of the assigned resource set. (OKTA-826548)

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.03.1

* `createdBy` and `lastUpdatedBy` custom attributes couldn't be used in group rules. (OKTA-566492)

* Custom admins who were limited to viewing only application group members received incomplete results when using the `List All Users API` without a `search` or `filter` parameter. (OKTA-801592)

* The JSON Web Token that Okta generates and sends to the OpenID Connect identity provider contained a string `exp` instead of a number 'exp'. (OKTA-852446)

* When making POST requests to `users/{userId}/factors/{factorId}/verify` or `authn/factors/{factorId}/verify` endpoints with `factorType` instead of `factorId` in the URL path, multiple failed verification attempts didn't lock users out and the failed attempts weren't logged in the System Log. (OKTA-871469)

* When Okta sent a request with a refresh token to the token inline hook, the session user was sometimes sent rather than the refresh token user in `request.data.context`. (OKTA-869758)

#### Global token revocation for wizard SAML and OIDC apps is GA in Production

Universal Logout clears sessions and tokens for wizard SAML and OIDC apps. This enhancement extends Universal Logout functionality to more types of apps and provides greater flexibility to admins.

#### OIDC IdPs now support group sync is GA in Production

OpenID Connect identity providers (IdPs) now support full group sync and adding a user to a group that they don't already belong to. A user who authenticates with an external IdP is added to all available groups when **Full sync of groups** is enabled. The user is added to any groups that they don't already belong to when **Add user to missing groups** is enabled. This allows you to specify certain groups that users should be added to. <!-- GROUP_SYNC_FEATURE_OIDC_IDP_ENABLED (https://oktainc.atlassian.net/browse/OKTA-817450#icft=OKTA-817450) -->

#### Granular account linking for certain Identity Providers is GA in Production

When admins link users from SAML and OIDC identity providers, they can now exclude specific users and admins. This improves security by allowing admins to configure granular access control scenarios. See **Add an external Identity Provider** for [OpenId Connect](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta) and [SAML 2.0](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/saml2/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!-- EXTENDED_ACCOUNT_LINKING_FILTERS OKTA-831244-->

#### Realms for Workforce is GA in Production

The Realms and Realms Management APIs allow you to unlock greater flexibility in managing and delegating the management of your distinct user populations within a single Okta org. See [Realms](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Realm/) and [Realm Assignments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RealmAssignment/).   <!--- https://oktainc.atlassian.net/browse/OKTA-853176#icft=OKTA-853176 UD_REALMS_FOUNDATIONS and UD_REALMS -->

#### Improved group search functionality is GA in Production

You can now search for groups whose names or descriptions contain specified text. This makes it easier to find a group when you don't recall its exact name. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter of the Groups API. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators) and [`search` within the Groups API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!in=query&path=search&t=request). <!--OKTA-862579 DIRECTORY_SERVICE_GROUP_CONTAINS_SEARCH-->

#### Improved user search functionality is GA in Production

You can now search for users whose names, email addresses, or usernames contain specified text. This makes it easier to do user lookups and add users to groups. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter of the Users API. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators) and [`search` within the Users API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers!in=query&path=search&t=request). <!--OKTA-862577 DIRECTORY_SERVICE_USER_CONTAINS_SEARCH-->

#### Improved realms and device search functionality is GA in Production

We've extended the contains (`co`) operator to realms and devices. You can now search for realms and devices whose profile attributes contain specified text through API. This makes lookups easier without needing to recall the exact names of various profile attributes. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter. See [Contains operator](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#contains-operator) and the `search` parameter in the [Realms](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Realm/#tag/Realm/operation/listRealms!in=query&path=search&t=request) and [Devices](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Device/#tag/Device/operation/listDevices!in=query&path=search&t=request) APIs. <!-- OKTA-865940 -->

#### New End-user Enrollments API is GA in Preview

The new [End-user Enrollments API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-signin-experience-management/signinexp/tag/endUserEnrollments/) enables end users to enroll and unenroll authenticators by entering a URL directly into their browser. This reduces the time spent administering complex authenticator enrollment flows, and provides a streamlined enrollment process for users. After a user enrolls or unenrolls an authenticator, you can use the `redirect_uri` property to redirect them to another page.<!-- OKTA-868775 ENG_AUTHENTICATOR_ENROLLMENTS_USER_MANAGEMENT_WITH_REDIRECT -->

#### CLEAR Verified as a third-party identity verification provider is EA in Preview

Okta now supports using CLEAR Verified as an identity provider. This increases the number of identity verification vendors (IDVs) you can use to verify the identity of your users when they onboard or reset their account. Set `IDV_CLEAR` as the IdP `type` when you [create an IdP](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProvider/#tag/IdentityProvider/operation/createIdentityProvider).<!-- https://oktainc.atlassian.net/browse/OKTA-848097#icft=OKTA-848097 IDV_STANDARD_INTEGRATION -->

#### Verify an SSF Stream is EA in Preview

Okta SSF Transmitter now supports the verification endpoint to enable receivers to request verification events and validate the end-to-end delivery between the transmitter and receiver. In addition, the SSF Transmitter verification events claim structure is now compliant with the OpenID Shared Signals Framework ID3 spec. <!-- OKTA_SSF_TRANSMITTER_PUSH_VERIFICATION_ENDPOINT into OKTA_SSF_TRANSMITTER_PUSH -->

#### MyAccount Password API updates

Admins can now send a PUT request to the `/idp/myaccount/password` endpoint to update the password for a user. Also, admins can send a GET request to the `/idp/myaccount/password/complexity-requirements` endpoint to retrieve password complexity requirements. See [Replace a Password](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-myaccount/myaccount/tag/Password/#tag/Password/operation/replacePassword) and [Retrieve the Password Complexity Requirements](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-myaccount/myaccount/tag/Password/#tag/Password/operation/getPasswordRequirements). <!-- FFs ENG_ENABLE_MY_ACCOUNT_CHANGE_PASSWORD and ENG_ENABLE_MY_ACCOUNT_GET_PASSWORD_REQUIREMENTS -->

#### Identity Security Posture Management functionality in the OIN catalog

The **Okta Integration Network** page now provides **Identity Security Posture Management** functionality. When you select it, the OIN catalog displays only the apps with Identity Security Posture Management functionality.

#### Default global session policy rule update

The default value for the `maxSessionLifetimeMinutes` property of the default global session policy rule is now `1440` (24 hours) and can be changed. Previously the `maxSessionLifetimeMinutes` property of the default global session policy rule was read-only.
See the [Policies API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Policy/#tag/Policy/operation/createPolicyRule!path=3/actions/signon/session/maxSessionLifetimeMinutes&t=request).

#### Developer documentation updates in 2025.03.0

* The list of public permissions has moved from the [Roles in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#permissions) topic to the [Permissions in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/permissions) topic. The new topic contains more permission details for you to define your custom admin roles.<!--OKTA-857969-->

* A new section has been added to the API documentation: [Sign-in Experience API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-signin-experience-management/guides/overview/). It contains the new End-user Enrollments API that enables end users to enroll and unenroll authenticators by entering a URL directly into their browser.<!-- OKTA-868775 -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.03.0

* Some certificates with trailing characters were uploaded successfully to the `/domains/{domainId}/certificate` endpoint, despite their invalid format. (OKTA-486406)

* An incorrect response was returned when a `/token` request was sent with an inactive user in a direct authentication flow. (OKTA-853984)

#### Incode as a third-party identity verification provider is EA in Preview

Okta now supports using Incode as an identity provider. This increases the number of identity verification vendors (IDVs) you can use to verify the identity of your users when they onboard or reset their account. Set `IDV_INCODE` as the IdP `type` when you [create an IdP](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProvider/#tag/IdentityProvider/operation/createIdentityProvider). <!-- OKTA-848097  IDV_STANDARD_INTEGRATION -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.02.2

* An API request to create a resource set with a duplicate name sometimes returned a 5xx error instead of a 4xx error response. (OKTA-867792)

* Admins couldn't retrieve more than five entitlement SAML assertions and OIDC claims when configuring apps. (OKTA-865900)

* The contains (`co`) operator sometimes gave unclear error messages when using less than three characters or with other operators. (OKTA-846206)

* When an admin attempted to revoke an API token (`DELETE /api/v1/api-tokens/{apiTokenId}`), and the credential used to authenticate the request was an `access_token` for a Service client, an HTTP 403 error was returned. (OKTA-844384)

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.02.1

* When a GET request was made using the User Grants API (`/api/v1/users/{userId}/grants`), the response didn't include pagination links in the response header. (OKTA-826775)

* The Users API returned inconsistent responses in Classic Engine orgs that allowed self-service registration and in Identity Engine orgs that were migrated from these orgs. (OKTA-833094)

* In the Admin Console, updates in the code editor that Okta couldn't parse returned a 500 Internal Server Error. (OKTA-837068)

* The On-Behalf of Token Exchange flow was returning the wrong error message when an invalid `subject_token_type` was requested. (OKTA-841223)

* When a POST request was made (`/api/v1/authorizationServers/{authServerId}/policies`) to create an authorization policy, the `created` and `lastUpdated` properties had a null value. (OKTA-848623)

* The `/user/verify_idx_credentials` endpoint didn't accept arbitrary `fromUri` values. (OKTA-853353)

* AMR values weren't forwarded to the app when a user signed in and Okta-to-Okta claims sharing was configured. (OKTA-860242)

* Some identity provider API POST (`/api/v1/idps`) and PUT (`/api/v1/idps/{idpId}`) requests returned an HTTP 500 error code if the request didn't have the `policy.accountLink` object in the request body. (OKTA-865143)

#### IP Exempt Zone is GA in Preview

This feature introduces `useAsExemptList` as a read-only Boolean property that distinguishes the new default IP exempt zones from other zones. When you enable this feature and you make a GET `api/v1/zones` request, Okta returns `useAsExemptList` in the response. The value `true` indicates that the zone is an exempt zone. Only system generated exempt zones are available. <!-- DEFAULT_NETWORK_ZONE_IP_EXEMPT_LIST (OKTA-795812: Parent Jira for DEFAULT_NETWORK_ZONE_IP_EXEMPT_LIST GA Preview) -->

#### Global token revocation for wizard SAML and OIDC apps is GA in Preview

Universal Logout clears sessions and tokens for wizard SAML and OIDC apps. This enhancement extends Universal Logout functionality to more types of apps and provides greater flexibility to admins. <!-- FF GLOBAL_TOKEN_REVOCATION_SUPPORT (OKTA-797187)-->

#### OIDC IdPs now support group sync is GA in Preview

OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers (IdPs) now support full group sync and adding a user to a group that they don't already belong to. A user who authenticates with an external IdP is added to all available groups when **Full sync of groups** is enabled. The user is added to any groups that they don't already belong to when **Add user to missing groups** is enabled. This allows you to specify certain groups that users should be added to. <!-- GROUP_SYNC_FEATURE_OIDC_IDP_ENABLED (OKTA-817450: FVM for EA Self-Service GROUP_SYNC_FEATURE_OIDC_IDP_ENABLED for Weekly Release 2024.10.1 Resolved) -->

#### Granular account linking for certain identity providers is GA

When admins link users from SAML and OIDC identity providers, they can now exclude specific users and admins. This improves security by allowing admins to configure granular access control scenarios. See **Add an external Identity Provider** for [OpenID Connect](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta) and [SAML 2.0](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/saml2/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!-- EXTENDED_ACCOUNT_LINKING_FILTERS OKTA-831244-->

#### Realms for Workforce is GA in Preview

The Realms and Realms Management APIs allow you to unlock greater flexibility in managing and delegating the management of your distinct user populations within a single Okta org. See [Realms](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Realm/) and [Realm Assignments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RealmAssignment/). <!--- OKTA-853176: Parent Jira for UD_REALMS_FOUNDATIONS and UD_REALMS Open UD_REALMS_FOUNDATIONS and UD_REALMS -->

#### Improved group search functionality is GA in Preview

You can now search for groups whose names or descriptions contain specified text. This makes it easier to find a group when you don't recall its exact name. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter of the Groups API. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators) and `search` within the [Groups API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!in=query&path=search&t=request). <!--OKTA-862579 DIRECTORY_SERVICE_GROUP_CONTAINS_SEARCH-->

#### Improved user search functionality is GA in Preview

You can now search for users whose names, email addresses, or usernames contain specified text. This makes it easier to add users to groups or apps. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter of the Users API. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators) and `search` within the [Users API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers!in=query&path=search&t=request). 
<!--OKTA-862577 DIRECTORY_SERVICE_USER_CONTAINS_SEARCH-->

#### Support for importing Active Directory group descriptions is GA in Production

The descriptions of groups sourced from Active Directory now use their description from AD. These replace any previous descriptions of AD-sourced groups in Okta, which used a pretty-printed version of the distinguished name (DN) instead.<!-- FF IMPORT_AD_GROUP_DESCRIPTION OKTA-863277 -->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2025.02.0

* The [Style the Sign-In Widget (third generation)](/docs/guides/custom-widget-gen3/main/#use-the-aftertransform-function-recommended) guide, under **Brand and Customize**, now describes how to use the `afterTransform` function. The function allows you to apply DOM customizations to the third generation of the widget. For example, you can use `afterTransform` to change button text or to add an instructional paragraph. <!-- OKTA-756971-->
* The new [Configure a device assurance policy](/docs/guides/device-assurance-policies/main/) guide, under **Sign users in**, describes how to manage device assurance policies in your org. The guide uses the [Device Assurance Policies API](/docs/guides/device-assurance-policies/main/) to create and edit a policy, and add device assurance to an authentication policy. It also shows how to use the [System Log API](/docs/reference/system-log-query/) to check for device assurance events. <!-- OKTA-825476 -->
* The [OIN Manager: submit an integration](/docs/guides/submit-app/apiservice/main/) guide has been updated to include **API service** submission instructions. <!-- OKTA-809892 -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.02.0

* When calling deleted app users through the Apps API, the API returned a 500 internal server error instead of a 404 error. (OKTA-832609)
* PUT requests (`/api/v1/apps/appId`) to update an OpenID Connect app took 30 seconds to complete. (OKTA-852488)
* When the [List all devices API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Device/#tag/Device/operation/listDevices) was used with a `search` query parameter, it sometimes returned outdated records for `screenLockType` and `managementStatus`.  (OKTA-856387)

#### Authentication claims sharing between Okta orgs is EA in Preview

Authentication claims sharing allows an admin to configure their Okta org to trust claims from IdPs during SSO. Sharing claims also allows Okta to interpret the authentication context from an IdP. This helps eliminate duplicate factor challenges during user authentication and helps improve security posture. See [Configure claims sharing](/docs/guides/configure-claims-sharing/oktasaml/main/).<!-- ORG2ORG_CLAIMS_SHARING OKTA-856733 -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.01.2

* When the Default Network Zone IP Exempt List feature was enabled for an org, an admin was able to delete the default example IP zone using the Zones API (`/api/v1/zones/{DefaultExemptIpZone ID}`). (OKTA-817263)
* The [List all principal rate limits](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/PrincipalRateLimit/#tag/PrincipalRateLimit/operation/listPrincipalRateLimitEntities) returned an empty response when querying with a custom `client_id` and using OAuth 2.0 for authentication.  (OKTA-832687)
* When a super admin updated a deactivated user to a different realm, admins received a `Resource not found` error. (OKTA-699778)
* Events for tokens revoked in bulk for a resource didn't appear in the System Log. (OKTA-834025)
* Refresh tokens for OpenID Connect apps that have Single Logout enabled with user session details were getting invalidated before their max lifetime. (OKTA-730794)
* Account unlock didn't work for some orgs using the Okta account management policy. (OKTA-848066)

* Automation
* Centralized Logging
* Directory and HR Sync
* Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

See [OIN Wizard use case selection](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#oin-wizard-use-case-selection). <!-- OKTA-843778 -->

#### Configure Identity Verification with third-party Identity Verification providers is GA Production

You can now configure third-party Identity Verification providers using the IdP API and [Okta account management policy rules](/docs/guides/okta-account-management-policy/main/). Okta supports Persona as a third-party Identity Verification provider.

Identity Verification enables you to use a third-party Identity Verification provider to verify the identity of your users. Verification requirements and the Identity Verification provider are based on your authentication policies and configurations within your Okta org. To configure an Identity Verification provider in the Admin Console, see [Add an Identity Verification vendor as Identity Provider](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=id-verification). <!-- OKTA-803683 -->

#### Deprecated API endpoints: Extend, Grant, and Revoke Okta Support access

The following API endpoints have been deprecated:

* [Extend Okta Support access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/OrgSettingSupport/#tag/OrgSettingSupport/operation/extendOktaSupport) (`POST /api/v1/org/privacy/oktaSupport/extend`)
* [Grant Okta Support access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/OrgSettingSupport/#tag/OrgSettingSupport/operation/grantOktaSupport) (`POST /api/v1/org/privacy/oktaSupport/grant`)
* [Revoke Okta Support access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/OrgSettingSupport/#tag/OrgSettingSupport/operation/revokeOktaSupport) (`POST /api/v1/org/privacy/oktaSupport/revoke`)

Use the [Update an Okta Support case](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/OrgSettingSupport/#tag/OrgSettingSupport/operation/updateOktaSupportCase) endpoint to extend, grant, or revoke Okta Support access for a specific support case. For the corresponding Okta Admin Console feature, see [Give access to Okta Support](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=settings-support-access). <!-- OKTA-823338 -->

#### Granular configuration for Keep Me Signed In is EA in Preview

Admins can now configure the post-authentication prompt for Keep Me Signed In (KMSI) at a granular level in authentication policies. This allows admins to selectively enable post-authentication KMSI on a per-user, per-group, or per-app basis. When enabled, this feature exposes a frequency setting that lets admins control how often the post-authentication prompt is presented to users. See [Configure Keep me signed in (KMSI)](/docs/guides/keep-me-signed-in/main/).

The post-authentication prompt text (title, subtitle, accept button, and reject button) is now customizable through the Brands API. See [Customize post-authentication sign-in prompts](/docs/guides/keep-me-signed-in/main/#customize-post-authentication-sign-in-prompts). <!-- OKTA-791596 FF: POST_AUTH_KMSI_IN_AUTH_POLICY  -->

#### Multiple Identifiers is GA in Preview

Today, end users must sign in to Okta with a username or email address only. With the Multiple Identifiers feature, admins can configure identifiers, or user attributes from Universal Directory, that an end user can enter to authenticate. Multiplier identifiers work in sign-in, recovery, self-service registration, and unlock flows. Admins can configure up to three identifiers, including email (which is still a required identifier). See [Configure multiple identifiers](/docs/guides/multiple-identifiers/main/). <!-- OKTA-687191  FF: MULTIPLE_IDENTIFIERS -->

#### New group.source.id key for group functions in Expression Language

You can now use the `group.source.id` key in Expression Language group functions to filter between groups that have the same name. See [Group functions](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language-in-identity-engine/#group-functions). <!-- OKTA-832132 -->

#### POST requests to the authorize endpoint is Self-Service EA

You can now send user data securely in a POST request body to the /authorize endpoint. <!-- https://oktainc.atlassian.net/browse/OKTA-827104#icft=OKTA-827104 OAUTH2_AUTHORIZE_WITH_POST -->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2025.01.0

The Sign users in to your SPA using redirect guides for the [Angular](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/angular/main/) and [React](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/react/main/) platforms are now revised to use updated versions of Okta SDKs, framework dependencies, and coding patterns.

#### Bug fixed in 2025.01.0

Requests to the `/policies/{policyId}/rules` and `/policies/{policyId}/rules/{ruleId}` endpoints to create or update Okta account management policy rules included default Keep me signed in (KMSI) settings in the responses. (OKTA-848236)
