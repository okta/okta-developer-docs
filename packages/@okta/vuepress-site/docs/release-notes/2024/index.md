#### DPoP support for Okta management APIs is GA in Preview

You can now use OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) access tokens to access Okta management APIs.
See [Configure OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession](/docs/guides/dpop/oktaresourceserver/main/). <!-- OKTA-673922 OKTA_RESOURCE_SERVER_DPOP_SUPPORT-->

#### Read-only permission for admin role assignments is GA in Production

Super admins can now assign the **View roles, resources, and admin assignments** permission to their delegated admins. This permission gives admins a read-only view of the admin roles, resource sets, and admin assignments in the org. See [About role permission](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-about-role-permissions). <!-- OKTA-640563 IAM_READ_RESOURCES -->

#### Seamless ISV experience is GA in Preview

Okta now provides a seamless ISV experience to optimize the [Okta Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/) submission experience for SAML and OIDC integrations. This new experience enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to build and manually test their integration metadata before submission. This reduces the time needed for the OIN team to review and validate that the integration functions as intended, which shortens the time to publish in the OIN.

This experience also incorporates communication processes in Salesforce, enabling improved collaboration internally within Okta teams and externally with ISVs. See [Publish an OIN integration](/docs/guides/submit-app-overview/) overview and [Submit an SSO integration with the OIN Wizard](/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/) guide. <!-- OKTA-663167  APP_MANIFESTS -->

#### System Log events for IdP keystore operations

New System Log events are generated for IdP keystore operations:

```bash
system.idp.key.create
system.idp.key.update
system.idp.key.delete
```
<!-- OKTA-680513 -->

#### Updated RADIUS authentication prompts

RADIUS authentication prompts are updated to be clearer.
<!-- OKTA-678869 -->
