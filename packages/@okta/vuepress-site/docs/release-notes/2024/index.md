#### Permission conditions for profile attributes is GA in Production

You can now apply conditions to the **View users and their details** and **Edit users' profile attributes** custom admin role permissions. Permission conditions help you limit the scope of a role by including or excluding admins' access to individual profile attributes. This gives you more granular control over your custom admin roles and helps meet your org’s unique security needs. See [Permission conditions](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-permission-conditions). <!-- OKTA-586185 -->

#### Content Security Policy for custom domains is GA in Preview

The Content Security Policy (CSP) feature lets admins control which URLs may be linked to from customized sign-in and error pages in orgs that use custom domains. Admins add trusted URLs to Okta that link to items such as images and add these links to the code in their sign-in and error pages. This feature enhances security by enabling admins to allow only approved content to appear and prevent the introduction of potentially malicious code to these pages. See [Content Security Policy (CSP) for your custom domain](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#content-security-policy-csp-for-your-custom-domain). <!-- OKTA-600774 FF CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_FOR_CUSTOMIZABLE_SIGN_IN_AND_ERROR_PAGES -->

#### New mappings property for Policy API is EA in Preview

A new `mappings` property is available for the `links` object in  `GET /api/v1/policies/${policyId}` and `GET /api/v1/policies?type=${type}` responses. This property displays links to policy mappings. See [Policy API](/docs/reference/api/policy/#links-object). <!-- OKTA-637310 -->

#### AAL values for Login.gov IdP

The [Login.gov IdP configuration](/docs/guides/add-logingov-idp/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta) has been updated to include all allowed AAL values. <!-- OKTA-673125 -->

#### Externally signed org AS access tokens

Access tokens returned from the org authorization server are now signed using the externally published signing key. These access tokens must still be treated as opaque strings and not be validated or consumed by any application other than Okta. <!-- OKTA-694170 -->

#### Support case management for admins is GA in Preview

Super admins can now assign the **View, create, and manage Okta support cases** permission and Support Cases resource to a custom admin role. This allows delegated admins to manage the support cases that they’ve opened. See [About role permissions](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-about-role-permissions). <!-- OKTA-700229 -->

#### Realms for Workforce

Realms allows you to unlock greater flexibility in managing and delegating management of your distinct user populations within a single Okta org. See the [Realms](/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Realms) and [Realm Assignments](/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RealmAssignments) APIs. <!-- OKTA-702163 -->

#### Enhanced app API contracts

Okta has API documentation on creating instances of custom apps. Yet, it doesn’t fully describe the app metadata required for features such as SSO and provisioning for apps installed from the Okta Integration Network (OIN). In an effort to improve the API for apps in the OIN, new app metadata contracts have been added to the Okta management API. Operators and developers can programmatically create instances of popular OIN apps in their ecosystem and set up the provisioning connection. See [Set up an app provisioning connection](/docs/guides/app-provisioning-connection/main/). <!-- OKTA-703567 -->


#### Bugs fixed in 2024.03.1

* Okta required a `sharedSecret` length of 16 characters when enrolling a Google Authenticator using the Factors API. Okta now accepts `sharedSecret` lengths between 16 and 32 characters. (OKTA-654920)

* Some group claims failed if Okta Expression Language was used. (OKTA-660870)

* An inline hook secured by an OAuth 2.0 token that had no expiry value returned an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. (OKTA-702184)

## February

### Weekly release 2024.02.2

| Change | Expected in Preview Orgs |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| [Bugs fixed in 2024.02.2](#bugs-fixed-in-2024-02-2) | February 22, 2024 |

#### Bugs fixed in 2024.02.2

<!-- * The number of unsuccessful calls to the `/api/v1/authn` endpoint sometimes exceeded the threshold set in the password policy settings. (OKTA-698017) Removed for 2024.02.2 as per doc action-->

* Okta sometimes incorrectly returned an Invalid Phone Number error during SMS factor enrollment. (OKTA-683026)

* Sometimes, an OAuth 2.0-secured inline hook that contained a custom domain authorization server in the token URL returned a null pointer exception error, instead of an appropriate error. (OKTA-656265)

* User passwords could be updated to match the answer to the recovery question. (OKTA-654993)

### Weekly release 2024.02.1

| Change | Expected in Preview Orgs |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| [HTTP header filter](#http-header-filter) | February 22, 2024 |
| [Bug fixed in 2024.02.1](#bug-fixed-in-2024-02-1) | February 14, 2024 |

#### HTTP header filter

To improve the security of your org, Okta now filters and encodes any illegal unicode characters for outgoing HTTP headers. <!-- OKTA-694896 -->

#### Bug fixed in 2024.02.1

The List all enrolled Factors endpoint (`GET /api/v1/users/{userId}/factors`) returned an incorrectly prefixed ID for SMS factors with a PENDING ACTIVATION status. (OKTA-690496)

### Monthly release 2024.02.0

| [Bugs fixed in 2024.02.0](#bugs-fixed-in-2024-02-0) | February 7, 2024 |

#### Assign admin roles to an app

Orgs can now assign admin roles to their custom API Service Integrations. Apps with assigned admin roles are constrained to the permissions and resources that are included in the role assignment. This helps ensure that apps only have access to the resources that are needed to perform their tasks and improves orgs' overall security. See [Work with the admin component](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-work-with-admin). <!-- OKTA-659638 CLIENT_AS_PRINCIPAL -->

#### DPoP support for Okta management APIs is GA in Production

You can now use OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) access tokens to access Okta management APIs. See [Configure OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession](/docs/guides/dpop/oktaresourceserver/main/). <!-- OKTA-673922 OKTA_RESOURCE_SERVER_DPOP_SUPPORT-->

#### New attribute to manage SAML app session lifetimes is EA in Preview

The `samlAssertionLifetimeSeconds` parameter is an optional SAML parameter that allows the IdP to control the session at the SP. This parameter allows users to add `samlAssertionLifetimeSeconds` as an attribute in the SAML assertion to control the session lifetimes of SP apps using the Okta IdP. See the [Settings table](/docs/reference/api/apps/#settings-9) in the **Add custom SAML application** section. <!-- OKTA-690479 SAML_ASSERTION_LIFETIME_SECONDS_ON_APPS_API -->

#### New function for email templates is EA in Preview

You can now use the `getTimeDiffHoursNow` function in each of the available email notification templates. If you want to add more locales when customizing email templates, you need to use this function instead of the `formatTimeDiffHoursNowInUserLocale` function. The new function returns only the time value in the specified unit. See [Enable additional locales](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#enable-additional-locales). <!-- OKTA-683897 -->

#### POST requests now allowed to the logout endpoint

You can now access the `/oauth2/{id}/v1/logout` and `/oauth2/v1/logout` endpoints with a POST request. See [POST logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/OrgAS/#tag/OrgAS/operation/logoutWithPost). <!-- OKTA-649530 -->

#### Seamless ISV experience is GA in Production

Okta now provides a seamless ISV experience to optimize the [Okta Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/) submission experience for SAML and OIDC integrations. This new experience enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to build and manually test their integration metadata before submission. This reduces the time needed for the OIN team to review and validate that the integration functions as intended, which shortens the time to publish in the OIN. This experience also incorporates communication processes in Salesforce, enabling improved collaboration internally within Okta teams and externally with ISVs. See [Publish an OIN integration](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-app-overview/) overview and [Submit an SSO integration with the OIN Wizard](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/) guide. <!-- OKTA-663167 APP_MANIFESTS -->

#### Developer documentation update in 2024.02.0

* Instructions for [testing Okta REST APIs with Postman](/docs/reference/rest/) have been updated to provide OAuth 2.0 authentication set up and use. OAuth 2.0 is recommended to access Okta management APIs instead of the proprietary SSWS API token to ensure enhanced security.

  These instructions are now under **References** > **Test APIs with Postman**.

* The [Self-service registration](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-self-reg/) guide is now easier to read and quicker to complete. All flow diagrams have been updated so they are easier to follow, and configuration instructions now match the current Admin Console.

#### Bugs fixed in 2024.02.0

* Some `call` Factor enrollments were left in a pending activation state after enrollment or reset. (OKTA-649508)

* When users signed in with an external Identity Provider and the multiple matching users error occurred, they were redirected to the sign-in page instead of the error page. (OKTA-658717)

See [Content Security Policy (CSP) for your custom domain](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#content-security-policy-csp-for-your-custom-domain). <!-- OKTA-600774 FF CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_FOR_CUSTOMIZABLE_SIGN_IN_AND_ERROR_PAGES -->

#### IP restrictions on tokens

Admins can specify allowlisted and blocklisted network zones for static, Single Sign-On Web System (SSWS) API tokens. This strengthens org security by letting them control where calls to Okta APIs can originate from. It also restricts attackers and malware from stealing SSWS tokens or replaying them outside of their IP range to gain unauthorized access. <!-- OKTA-689850 -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2024.01.2

* POST requests to the `/sessions/me/lifecycle/refresh` endpoint didn't return an updated session cookie. (OKTA-665452)

* System Log events for the access token, ID token, and user SSO grants didn't include `externalSessionId`. (OKTA-664370)

* System Log events for access token and ID token grants didn't include user attributes. (OKTA-674218)

#### Read-only permission for admin role assignments is GA in Production

Super admins can now assign the **View roles, resources, and admin assignments** permission to their delegated admins. This permission gives admins a read-only view of the admin roles, resource sets, and admin assignments in the org.
