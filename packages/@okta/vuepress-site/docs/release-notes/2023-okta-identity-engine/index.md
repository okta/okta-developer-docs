#### SMS and Voice support for OOB and MFA OOB grant flows is EA in Preview

Direct authentication out-of-band (OOB) and multifactor out-of-band (MFA OOB) grant flows now support the phone authenticator with SMS and voice factors. See [Phone (MFA)](/docs/guides/configure-direct-auth-grants/fmfaoobsv/main/) and [Phone (primary factor)](/docs/guides/configure-direct-auth-grants/eoobsv/main/). <!-- OKTA-659932 -->

#### Org detail retrieval and user app listing for My Account API is GA in Preview

Two new endpoints for the My Account API (`/idp/myaccount/organization` and `/idp/myaccount/okta-applications`) allow customers to retrieve org details and get a full list of the current user's Okta apps for a particular end user. See [My Account API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-myaccount/guides/overview/). <!-- OKTA-651405, OKTA-663355 -->

#### CORS restrictions removed for revoke endpoints

Cross-origin resource sharing restrictions have been removed for the OAuth 2.0 `/revoke` endpoints (`/oauth2/v1/revoke` and `/oauth2/{authorizationServerId}/v1/revoke`). <!-- OKTA-653124 -->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.11.0

The direct authentication grant types are now in a new [Configure Direct Authentication grant types](/docs/guides/configure-direct-auth-grants/coobov/main/) guide rather than the [Implement authorization by grant type](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main/) guide. The new guide presents the grant type flows by authenticator rather than grant type, and then further differentiates the flows by either primary factor or secondary (MFA) factor. The grant types are found on the following pages:
  * **OTP grant type** -> **OTP (primary factor)**: When you want to use an OTP factor, such as Google TOTP or Okta Verify, as a primary factor
  * **MFA OTP grant type** -> **OTP (MFA)**: When you want to use an OTP factor as a secondary factor (MFA)
  * **OOB grant type** -> **Okta Verify Push (primary factor)** and **Phone (primary factor)**: When you want to use an out-of-band factor as a primary factor
  * **MFA OOB grant type** -> **Okta Verify Push (MFA)** and **Phone (MFA)**: When you want to use an out-of-band factor as a secondary factor (MFA)

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.11.0

* When attempts were made to update the profiles of app users whose profiles were controlled by external apps, an incorrect error was returned. (OKTA-640752)

* Some operations for the Factors API (`GET /api/v1/users/${userId}/factors/{factorId}` and `GET /api/v1/users/me/factors/${factorId}`) weren't accessible when using tokens created by read-only admins. (OKTA-648751)

* When many apps were added to routing rules through the API, system performance was degraded. (OKTA-653756)

* When a partial set of AMRs was passed in an IdP-initiated flow, Okta redirected the user to the IdP instead of challenging for remaining factors. (OKTA-657359)

## October

### Weekly release 2023.10.2

| Change | Expected in Preview Orgs |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| [Bugs fixed in 2023.10.2](#bugs-fixed-in-2023-10-2) | November 1, 2023 |

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.10.2

* AMR claims weren't accepted when the inbound SAML assertion was encrypted. (OKTA-658533)

* An error occurred when the value for `postLogoutRedirectUris` in an OpenID Connect app was more than 65,535 characters. (OKTA-627678)

* Authorize requests with invalid `max_age` parameter values resulted in errors. (OKTA-654751)

### Weekly release 2023.10.1

| Change | Expected in Preview Orgs |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| [Granular permissions to manage directories is self-service EA in Preview](#granular-permissions-to-manage-directories-is-self-service-ea-in-preview) | October 18, 2023 |
| [Bug fixed in 2023.10.1](#bug-fixed-in-2023-10-1) | October 24, 2023 |

#### Granular permissions to manage directories is self-service EA in Preview

This feature enables you to assign permissions to view and manage directories as part of a customized admin role. <!--OKTA-657510 FF: ENFORCE_NEW_DIRECTORY_PERM -->

#### Bug fixed in 2023.10.1

The Trusted Origins API didn't validate the `origin` parameter correctly. (OKTA-638649)

### Monthly release 2023.10.0

| Change | Expected in Preview Orgs |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| [Permission conditions for profile attributes is GA in Preview](#permission-conditions-for-profile-attributes-is-ga-in-preview) | October 12, 2023 |
| [Direct authentication endpoints now require channel_hint parameter](#direct-authentication-endpoints-now-require-channel-hint-parameter) | October 12, 2023 |
| [Updates to profile enrollment policy are GA in Production](#updates-to-profile-enrollment-policy-are-ga-in-production)  | September 13, 2023  |
| [Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession is GA](#demonstrating-proof-of-possession-is-ga) | March 15, 2023 |
| [Bugs fixed in 2023.10.0](#bugs-fixed-in-2023-10-0) | October 12, 2023 |

#### Permission conditions for profile attributes is GA in Preview

You can now apply conditions to the **View users and their details** and **Edit users' profile attributes** custom admin role permissions. Permission conditions help you limit the scope of a role by including or excluding admins' access to individual profile attributes. This gives you more granular control over your custom admin roles and helps meet your org's unique security needs. See [Permission conditions](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-permission-conditions). <!-- OKTA-586185 FF: CUSTOM_ADMIN_ROLES_CONDITIONS -->

#### Direct authentication endpoints now require channel_hint parameter

The `channel_hint` parameter is now required for direct authentication `/oob-authenticate` and `/challenge` endpoints.

#### Updates to profile enrollment policy are GA in Production

This feature delivers parity for upgraded orgs that used the Self-Service Registration (SSR) feature in Classic Engine. Previously in Identity Engine, SSR was combined with profile enrollment. Users were unable to sign in after the upgrade if their org used read-only or hidden attributes for SSR in Classic Engine. Identity Engine now separates SSR and profile enrollment, and turns off progressive profiling by default. This ensures that no admins are locked out and users can sign in to their orgs even if they have special attributes. <!-- OKTA-654425 FF: MAKE_ENROLLMENT_GREAT_AGAIN -->

#### Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession is GA

OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to OAuth 2.0 access tokens. It enables the client to demonstrate that it possesses a particular key or secret associated with the access token. OAuth 2.0 DPoP can help prevent certain attacks, such as token theft or token replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts a legitimate access token and uses it to gain unauthorized access to a protected resource. See [Configure OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession](/docs/guides/dpop/main/). <!-- OKTA-585491 FF: OAUTH2_DROP -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.10.0

* If an org had custom character restrictions on the `login` variable, POST requests to the `/idp/idx/enroll/new` endpoint with invalid `login` values returned an incorrect error message. (OKTA-631952)

* When an admin configured a custom email domain using the Email Domain API, they couldn't change the autogenerated CNAME record. (OKTA-645037)

* The Apps API displayed an error when admins tried to remove the Refresh Token grant type. (OKTA-630471)

* An Authentication Policy rule configured with `methods` and `types` parameters of a possession `constraint` object, incorrectly prompted users for a security question. (OKTA-642454)

* The Custom API Action card in Okta Workflows couldn't authenticate requests to `/api/v1/org/factors/yubikey_token/tokens` endpoints. (OKTA-639624)

Users were unable to sign in after the upgrade if their org used read-only or hidden attributes for SSR in Classic Engine. Identity Engine now separates SSR and profile enrollment, and turns off progressive profiling by default. This ensures that no admins are locked out and users can sign in to their orgs even if they have special attributes.

#### Automatically assign super admin role to an app
Admins can now automatically assign the super admin role to all of their newly created public client apps. See [Work with the admin component](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-work-with-admin).

#### Authentication challenge for redirects
Users now receive an authentication challenge for each redirect sent to an Identity Provider with **Factor only** configured, even if the IdP session is active. <!-- OKTA-628504 ENG_FORCE_AUTHN_FOR_FACTORS_IDPS -->

#### Number challenge support for OOB and MFA OOB grant flows is EA in Production
Direct authentication out-of-band (OOB) and multifactor out-of-band (MFA OOB) grant flows now support number challenge for Okta Verify Push. See the [MFA OOB grant](/docs/guides/configure-direct-auth-grants/dmfaoobov/main/) and [OOB grant](/docs/guides/configure-direct-auth-grants/coobov/main/) flows.

#### Policy Simulation API is GA in Preview
With the Policy API `/simulate` endpoint, you can quickly and easily test policies and validate whether your desired security outcomes are achieved. This endpoint allows you to simulate user access attributes, such as IP address, device, risk, and so on, to test whether the user is granted access to the specified application. This endpoint is implemented in the Admin Console as the [Access Testing Tool](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/identity-engine/policies/access-testing-tool.htm). The `/simulate` endpoint helps you identify potential security risks and compliance issues before you implement a policy. See the [Policy API](/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-simulation-operations) and [Test your policies with access simulations](/docs/guides/policy-simulation). <!-- OKTA-593826 POLICY_SIMULATION -->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.09.0

* The [Sign users in to your web app using the redirect model](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app-redirect/) guide is now easier to read and quicker to complete. This change also removes references to Okta CLI, removes Gin-specific example code from Go content, and adds new example code to ASP.NET content.
* The Style the sign-in page guide now describes how to hide or suppress the transient Sign-In Widget for redirect authentication. See [Hide or suppress the transient Sign-In Widget ](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#hide-or-suppress-the-transient-sign-in-widget).

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.09.0

* A token inline hook secured by an OAuth 2.0 private key returned a 403 error response for all users except the super admin. (OKTA-605996)
* Access policy evaluation for custom authorization servers was inconsistent when default scopes were used. (OKTA-627559)
* Admins couldn't make requests to MyAccount API (`/idp/myaccount/`) endpoints. (OKTA-632620)

#### Custom admin roles with device permissions is EA in Preview

You can now create custom admin roles with permissions to view and manage devices. You can add the [Devices resource](/docs/reference/api/roles/#supported-resources)&nbsp;to your resource set and then specify [device permissions](/docs/reference/api/roles/#permission-types)&nbsp;for your custom admin. <!-- OKTA-636437 CUSTOM_ADMIN_ROLE_DEVICES -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.08.1

* The Active Directory agent version returned by `/api/v1/agentPools/update` was in the format `x.y.z.a` instead of the expected `x.y.z`. (OKTA-597796)
* Federated users were unable to sign in to an app due to incorrect AMR value mapping when **Trust AMR claims from this Identity Provider** was enabled. (OKTA-604248)

#### Developer documentation updates in 2023.08.0

- New multibrand content is available that describes the behaviour of [branded emails](/docs/concepts/brands/#multibrand-and-emails) and when to trigger them from the Admin Console or from the APIs.

- A new [Terraform section](/docs/guides/terraform-landing-page/main/) is available that includes content for using Terraform to automate the management of your Okta org. These guides range from a Terraform overview to optimizing Terraform access in your Okta org. Additionally, there is content for managing user access, groups, and authentication services, customizing the end-user experience, and controlling Terraform access to your Okta org.

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.08.0

- Custom Push Factors used the same `provider` and `vendorName` properties as Okta Verify. These factors now return the `provider` as `CUSTOM` and the `vendorName` as the name of the authenticator. (OKTA-598598)
- Some of the endpoints of the [Resource Sets API](/docs/reference/api/roles/#resource-set-operations) didn't support `self` and `next` link relation types. (OKTA-571339)

#### Front-channel Single Logout is Self-Service EA in Preview

Front-channel Single Logout (SLO) allows a user to sign out of an SLO participating app on their device and end their Okta session. Okta then automatically sends a logout request to all other participating apps that the user accessed during their session. See [Configure Single Logout](/docs/guides/single-logout). <!-- OKTA-604441 SINGLE_LOGOUT_SUPPORT -->

#### Google Authenticator for account recovery is GA in Production

The Policy API Self-Service Password Reset object can now use Google Authenticator to initiate recovery scenarios. Previously, the object could only use the Email, Phone, or Okta Verify authenticators to initiate recovery. This addition enhances the user experience by increasing the number of options available for recovery.  See [Policy API](/docs/reference/api/policy/#self-service-password-reset-action-object). <!-- OKTA-609191 IDX_SSPR_EXTENDED_PRIMARY_FACTORS-->

#### Okta-generated client secret length increase

The length of Okta-generated client secrets has been increased from 40 to 64 characters.
<!-- OKTA-619134 -->

#### Smart Card authenticator is Self-Service GA in Preview

You can add a new Smart Card authenticator that enables Personal Identity Verification (PIV) to be used in authentication policies. You can also restrict the authentication policies to use only the Smart Card authenticator as MFA. See `properties.additionalAmr` in the updated [Identity Provider](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/idps/#identity-provider-attributes) attributes for `X509` Smart Card support.
<!-- OKTA-620437 X509_BASED_AUTHENTICATOR -->

#### ThreatInsight coverage on core Okta API endpoints is GA in Preview

Okta ThreatInsight coverage is now available for core Okta API endpoints ([OIDC & OAuth 2.0](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/), [Okta Management](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/overview/), and [MyAccount APIs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-myaccount/guides/overview/)). Based on heuristics and machine learning models, ThreatInsight maintains an evolving list of IP addresses that consistently show malicious activity across Okta's customer base. Requests from these bad IP addresses can be blocked or elevated for further analysis when ThreatInsight is enabled for an Okta org. Previously, ThreatInsight coverage only applied to Okta authentication endpoints (including enrollment and recovery endpoints). With this release, enhanced attack patterns are detected for authentication endpoints and limited attack patterns are also detected for non-authentication endpoints. There are no changes to the existing ThreatInsight configuration: you can still enable ThreatInsight with log and block mode, log mode, and exempt network zones. A new `Negative IP Reputation` reason is available for high `security.threat.detected` events. See [System Log events for Okta ThreatInsight](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-configure-threatinsight-system-log). <!-- OKTA-572915 ENG_ENABLE_TI_BASED_ON_OKTA_IP_REPUTATION -->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.07.0

The guides within the Primer for OIN OpenID Connect section have been removed. Content for OIDC protocol requirements, multi-tenancy, and best practices have been updated and merged to the [Overview of Single Sign-On in the OIN](/docs/guides/oin-sso-overview/) and [Build an SSO integration](/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/openidconnect/main/) guides. <!-- OKTA-447961 -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.07.0

* Sometimes HTTP response headers contained duplicate session ID references. (OKTA-621625)
* Smart Card authenticator responses returned multiple indistinguishable enrollments. (OKTA-556787)

#### API service integration client secret rotation

New in this release is the ability to rotate client secrets for an API service integration through the API. Previously, if a customer wanted to update the client secret for an API service integration, they would have to reinstall the integration to obtain a new client ID and secret. There was no option to revoke the client secret while maintaining the client ID and API service integration instance in Okta. With this new feature, customers can generate a new secret, deactivate an old secret, and remove a deactivated secret from the API service integration instance. These functionalities help customers implement security best practices without service downtime. See [API Service Integration](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ApiServiceIntegrations/#tag/ApiServiceIntegrations/operation/createApiServiceIntegrationInstanceSecret) API references. <!-- OKTA-584715 -->

#### Multibrand customizations are GA in Production

Multibrand customizations allow customers to use one org to manage multiple brands and multiple custom domains. This drastically simplifies multi-tenant architectures where customers create multiple orgs to satisfy branding requirements. Multibrand customizations allow orgs to create up to three custom domains (more upon request), which can be mapped to multiple sign-in pages, multiple sets of emails, error pages, and multiple versions of the End-User Dashboard. See [Brands](/docs/concepts/brands/).  <!-- OKTA-568807 -->

#### Pagination for the Brands API is GA in Production

The Brands API now supports [pagination](/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#pagination) when returning lists of brands. Previously, users would get a list of all brands in the org. With pagination, users receive 20 records per page. See [Customizations](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Customization/). <!-- OKTA-574011 -->

#### New custom authenticator for push notifications

Before now, Okta Verify was the only solution for using push notifications and biometrics as part of your Okta user verification strategy. Now, we have the Devices SDK, which lets you embed push notifications and biometric verification inside your organization's mobile apps. Your users are presented with a push and biometric experience within your organization's apps, with your organization's branding on it. They never have to leave your app, and they don't need to download a third-party app, such as Okta Verify, to complete their verification. See the [Custom authenticator integration guide](/docs/guides/authenticators-custom-authenticator/) for [Android](/docs/guides/authenticators-custom-authenticator/android/main/) and [iOS](/docs/guides/authenticators-custom-authenticator/ios/main) instructions. <!-- OKTA-580039 -->

#### Unique refresh token ID added to token inline hook requests

A unique refresh token ID is now included in token inline hook requests. This ensures that the refresh token ID is persisted in the request to maintain seamless access and improve security. This feature is now GA in production. <!-- OKTA-576905 -->

#### Transactional verification with CIBA is GA in Production

Organizations are constantly looking for ways to offer a frictionless user experience without compromising security. It becomes even more challenging when the users try to perform sensitive transactions. Okta uses Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) to provide customers with a simple and secure transaction verification solution.

CIBA extends OpenID Connect to define a decoupled flow where the authentication or transaction flow is initiated on one device and verified on another. The device in which the transaction is initiated by the OIDC application is called the consumption device, and the device where the user verifies the transaction is called the authentication device. See [Transactional verification using CIBA](/docs/guides/configure-ciba/main/). <!-- OKTA-584442 -->

#### Password hooks global availability is GA in Production

The [Create User with password import inline hook](/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook) operation is now available for all users. Previously, password hooks required a user to be in the `STAGED` status. This change helps better support migration efforts from DelAuth to Okta. <!-- OKTA-604521 -->

#### Google Authenticator for account recovery is now EA in Preview

The Policy API Self-Service Password Reset object can now use Google Authenticator to initiate recovery scenarios. Previously, the object could only use the Email, Phone, or Okta Verify authenticators to initiate recovery. This addition enhances the user experience by increasing the number of options available for recovery.  See [Policy API](/docs/reference/api/policy/#self-service-password-reset-action-object). <!-- OKTA-599821 -->

#### Policy Simulation API is EA in Preview

With the Policy API `/simulate` endpoint, you can quickly and easily test policies and validate whether your desired security outcomes will be achieved. This endpoint allows you to simulate user access attributes, such as IP address, device, risk, and so on, to test whether the user will be granted access to the specified application. This endpoint is implemented in the Admin Console as the [Access Testing Tool](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-access-testing-tool). The`/simulate` endpoint helps you identify potential security risks and compliance issues before you implement a policy. See [Policy API](/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-simulation-operations) and [Test your policies with access simulations](/docs/guides/policy-simulation/). <!--OKTA-593826-->

#### Universal Directory attribute and enum limits are GA in Production

Universal Directory now has limits to the number of attributes per org and the number of enums that can be defined for a single attribute. <!--OKTA-614625-->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.06.0

A new policy testing guide is available to demonstrate a new Policy API endpoint used to test access policies. This feature is also available in the Admin Console > Reports as the Access Testing Tool. See the new [simulate endpoint](/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-simulation-operations) in the API reference and [Test your policies with access simulations](/docs/guides/policy-simulation).

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.06.0

* Sometimes requests with an already used scope name didn't return appropriate error messages. (OKTA-570908)
* Some customers received a 500 internal server error in response to a List all apps request. (OKTA-597493)
* Unhelpful error messages appeared when the `NameIdPolicy` was unspecified in SAML client requests that required signed requests. (OKTA-607434)
* When labels for Universal Directory properties on the profile enrollment form were customized, the sign-in page showed default content. (OKTA-397225)
* The Identity Provider (IdP) AMR claims mapping feature ignored the IdP admin configuration for trusting AMR claims. (OKTA-615412)
* The `max_age=0` property wasn't treated the same as `prompt=login` for OAuth 2.0 `/authorize` requests. (OKTA-588559)

#### MyAccount API password update and 2FA support is EA in Preview

You can now use the [MyAccount API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-myaccount/myaccount/tag/Password/) to update passwords. Previously, you could only update non-authenticator attributes like first name or last name with the API. Also, Okta enforces 2FA for users that enroll any factor using the API. <!-- OKTA-612157 FF: IDP_MY_ACCOUNT_API_PASSWORD & IDP_MY_ACCOUNT_2FA_IF_POSSIBLE -->

#### AMR Claims Mapping for IdPs is EA in Preview

This feature allows admins to configure their org to accept Authentication Method Reference (AMR) claims from SAML or OpenID Connect IdPs during SSO. Mapping AMR claims for third-party IdPs eliminates duplicate factor challenges during user authentication. AMR claims provide important context to Okta during policy evaluation, enabling a better understanding of which factors were used by the external IdP to verify the user's identity. This creates a more seamless and secure user experience, reducing friction, and boosting productivity. See [Add an external Identity Provider](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/oktatookta/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!-- OKTA-612157 FF: IDP_AMR_CLAIMS_MAPPING -->

#### OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is GA in Production

OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/). <!--OKTA-572343--> <!--FF: ON_BEHALF_TOKEN_EXCHANGE-->

#### Multibrand customizations are GA in Preview

Multibrand customizations allow customers to use one org to manage multiple brands and multiple custom domains.

Multibrand customizations allow orgs to create up to three custom domains (more upon request), which can be mapped to multiple sign-in pages, multiple sets of emails, error pages, and multiple versions of the End-User Dashboard. See [Brands](/docs/concepts/brands/). <!--OKTA-587566, OKTA-568807-->

#### Password hooks global availability is GA in Preview

The [Create User with password import inline hook](/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook) operation is now available for all users. Previously, password hooks required a user to be in the `STAGED` status. This change helps better support migration efforts from DelAuth to Okta. <!--OKTA-604521--> <!--FF: ENG_ALLOW_PASSWORD_IMPORT_HOOKS_FOR_USERS_IN_ANY_STATUS--> <!--Originally available in December 2020-->

#### Event hook filtering is EA in Preview

You can now filter individual events of the same event type based on custom business logic hosted in Okta. These filters reduce the number of events that trigger hooks, removing an unnecessary load on your external service.

This feature includes an improved creation workflow for event hooks and a new **Filters** tab that you can use to create event filters with direct Expression Language statements or with a simple UI format.

Using event hook filters significantly reduces the amount of event hook requests and the need for custom code on your respective services. See [Which events are eligible](/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#which-events-are-eligible) and [Event hook filtering](/docs/guides/event-hook-filtering/main/). <!--OKTA-592286--> <!--FF: EVENT_HOOK_FILTERING-->

#### The new Direct Authentication API is EA in Preview

The [Direct Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/OrgAS/#tag/OrgAS/operation/token) offers a new set of OAuth grants that give app developers greater control over the authentication process. When redirect authentication isn't an option, you can use this API to allow client apps to authenticate users directly, without relying on HTTP redirection through a web browser. This is beneficial in scenarios where there's a high degree of trust between the user and the app. It's also beneficial where browser-based flows aren't feasible, like with mobile apps. By using the Direct Authentication API, app developers can tailor the authentication experience to their specific use case, resulting in a smoother and more efficient authentication process. See [Configure Direct Authentication grant types](/docs/guides/configure-direct-auth-grants/aotp/main/). <!--OKTA-585748--> <!--FF: DIRECT_AUTH-->

#### Identity store property for the Applications API

A new `identityStoreId` property is now available in the Applications API resource (`/api/v1/apps`) to store an identity store app associated with your app. You can set the `identityStoreId` value to the `id` of the identity store app you previously created in the same org. See the [optional `settings.identityStoreId` property](/docs/reference/api/apps/#identity-store-id). <!--OKTA-595777--> <!--FF: DYNAMIC_UI_APPS_API_AUGMENT--> <!--Orig avail 2023.04.2-->

#### Unique refresh token ID added to token inline hook requests

A unique refresh token ID is now included in token inline hook requests. This ensures that the refresh token ID is persisted in the request to maintain seamless access and improve security. <!--OKTA-576905--> <!--FF: ENG_REFRESH_TOKEN_ID_IN_TOKEN_INLINE_HOOK-->

#### Additional measures to counter toll fraud

For SMS and voice authentications, additional mitigation measures now help counter phone number-based toll fraud. <!--OKTA-603999--> <!--Set TEL_CAT_AREA_CODE_RL_RULE to HARD enforcement-->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.05.0

A new event hook guide is available that demonstrates the self-service EA feature event hook filtering. Filter only those event instances you want to trigger an event hook. See [Event hook filtering](/docs/guides/event-hook-filtering/main/). <!--OKTA-592286-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.05.0

* When an org upgraded to Identity Engine, MyAccount API calls to delete an unverified phone number (`DELETE /idp/myaccount/phones/{id}`) failed. (OKTA-586685)
* Admins saw Okta FastPass listed in the `GET /api/v1/users/{{userId}}/factors` response for users who didn't enable the factor. (OKTA-587429)

#### Support added for DPoP with service apps

Okta now supports [Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession](/docs/guides/dpop/main/) for service apps. However, service apps can provide the same level of security by using `private_key_jwt` for [client authentication](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/client-auth/).<!--OKTA-592258-->

#### OAuth 2.0 authentication for inline hooks is GA in Production

Okta inline hook calls to third-party external web services previously provided only header-based authentication for security. Although sent with SSL, the header or custom header authentication didn't meet more stringent security requirements for various clients and industries.

To improve the security of inline hooks, Okta now supports authentication with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Tokens ensure secure calls to external web services.

When creating inline hooks in the Admin Console (or by API), administrators or developers can now select OAuth 2.0 authentication and choose between two methods of OAuth 2.0: Client Secret or Private Key. A new Key Management API and Admin Console page is also available to create public/private key pairs for use with OAuth 2.0 inline hooks. See [Key management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-key-management).

Using the OAuth 2.0 framework provides better security than Basic Authentication or custom headers, and is less work than setting up an IP allowlisting solution. Clients also have the ability to use access tokens minted by their own custom authorization servers to guarantee that Okta is calling their client web services and isn't triggered by any external actors. See [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook). <!--OKTA-581803-->

#### API service integrations are GA in Production

A service-to-service app where a backend service or a daemon calls Okta management APIs for a tenant (Okta org) can be published in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) as an API service integration. This integration type allows your service app to access your customer Okta org through Okta management APIs using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow. API service integrations provide secure, reliable, and least-privilege scoped access to Okta APIs without being associated with a user, so service isn't disrupted when the user is no longer involved with service integration activities. See [API service integrations in the OIN](/docs/guides/oin-api-service-overview/). OIN Manager has been updated to support testing and submitting API service integrations. After your service integration is published in the OIN, workforce customers can discover and configure your integration with ease. See [Build an API service integration](/docs/guides/build-api-integration/main/). <!--OKTA-577514-->

#### OIN Manager support for Workflow Connector submission is GA in Production

Okta [Workflows](https://www.okta.com/platform/workflows/) is a no-code, if-this-then-that logic builder that Okta orgs can use to automate custom or complex employee onboarding and offboarding flows in your application. You can now publish Workflow connectors that you create with the [Workflows Connector Builder](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=wf&id=ext-connector-builder) in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) catalog. Publishing a Workflows connector with Okta allows your customers to deeply integrate your product with all other connectors in the catalog. Submit your Workflow connector by using the OIN Manager. See [Submit an integration](/docs/guides/submit-app/wfconnector/main/#submit-an-integration) for Workflows connectors. <!--OKTA-571943 & OKTA-573202-->

#### OAuth 2.0 grant scopes added

The OAuth 2.0 `okta.appGrants.manage` and `okta.appGrants.read` grant scopes are now available for use with the `/apps/{id}/grants` and `/apps/{id}/grants/{grantId}` endpoints.<!--OKTA-568970-->

#### Scope parameter length increased

The maximum length for the scope parameter of a refresh token request is now 4096 characters.<!--OKTA-573127-->

#### OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is GA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/). <!--OKTA-572343 -->

#### Configurable rate limits for OAuth 2.0 apps is GA in Production

Rate limit violations mainly occur on authenticated endpoints. Currently, it isn't clear which OAuth 2.0 authenticated app consumes all the rate limits for an org. This increases the risk that one app consumes the entire rate limit bucket. To avoid this possibility, Okta admins can now configure how much rate limit capacity an individual OAuth 2.0 app can consume by editing the Application rate limits tab for each app. By setting a capacity on individual OAuth 2.0 apps, Okta admins have a new tool to monitor and investigate rate limit violations, and have the ability to view rate limit traffic generated by individual OAuth 2.0 apps. See [Rate limit dashboard bar graph](/docs/reference/rl-dashboard/#bar-graph). <!--OKTA-573387-->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.04.0

A new sign-in redirect guide is available for single page apps (SPA) using JavaScript and the Auth JS SDK. No frontend framework required! A quick and easy demonstration of the redirect sign-in flow. See [Sign users in to your SPA using the redirect model and Auth JS](/docs/guides/auth-js-redirect/main/). <!--OKTA-577531-->

#### Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession is self-service EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to OAuth 2.0 access tokens. It enables the client to demonstrate that it possesses a particular key or secret associated with the access token. OAuth 2.0 DPoP can help prevent certain attacks, such as token theft or token replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts a legitimate access token and uses it to gain unauthorized access to a protected resource. See [Configure OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession](/docs/guides/dpop/main/). <!--OKTA-585491-->

#### Bug fixed in 2023.03.1

Using the Policy API, admins were able to set the `MFA_ENROLL` policy factor settings to allow Okta Verify Push but not allow Okta Verify OTP at the same time. (OKTA-567906)

#### Configurable rate limits for OAuth 2.0 apps is GA in Preview

Rate limit violations mainly occur on authenticated endpoints. Currently, it isn't clear which OAuth 2.0 authenticated app consumes all the rate limits for an org. This increases the risk that one app consumes the entire rate limit bucket. To avoid this possibility, Okta admins can now configure how much rate limit capacity an individual OAuth 2.0 app can consume by editing the Application rate limits tab for each app. By setting a capacity on individual OAuth 2.0 apps, Okta admins have a new tool to monitor and investigate rate limit violations, and have the ability to view rate limit traffic generated by individual OAuth 2.0 apps. See [Rate limit dashboard bar graph](/docs/reference/rl-dashboard/#bar-graph). <!--OKTA-573387-->

#### Authenticator enrollment using the /authorize endpoint is GA in Production

Authenticator enrollment provides a standardized way for a user to enroll a new authenticator using the OAuth `/authorize` endpoint. This feature uses query parameters such as prompt and `enroll_amr_values` to specify which authenticator the user wants to enroll. It also automatically verifies at least two factors as long the user has already enrolled two or more factors. <!--OKTA-544671-->

#### OIDC Identity Providers private/public key pair support is GA

Previously, Okta only supported the use of client secret as the client authentication method with an OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider. Okta now supports the use of private/public key pairs (`private_key_jwt`) with OpenID Connect-based Identity Providers. Additionally, the Signed Request Object now also supports the use of private/public key pairs. See [Create an Identity Provider in Okta](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#custom-okta-hosted-sign-in-page). <!--OKTA-573913-->

#### API service integrations are GA in Preview

A service-to-service app where a backend service or a daemon calls Okta management APIs for a tenant (Okta org) can be published in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) as an API service integration. This integration type allows your service app to access your customer Okta org through Okta management APIs using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow. API service integrations provide secure, reliable, and least-privilege scoped access to Okta APIs without being associated with a user, so service isn't disrupted when the user is no longer involved with service integration activities. See [API service integrations in the OIN](/docs/guides/oin-api-service-overview/). OIN Manager has been updated to support testing and submitting API service integrations. After your service integration is published in the OIN, workforce customers can discover and configure your integration with ease. See [Build an API service integration](/docs/guides/build-api-integration/main/). <!--OKTA-577514-->

#### Log Streaming is GA in Production

Many organizations use third-party systems to monitor, aggregate, and act on the event data in Okta System Log events.

Log Streaming enables Okta admins to more easily and securely send System Log events to a specified system, such as the Splunk Cloud or Amazon Eventbridge, in near real time with simple, pre-built connectors. Log streaming scales well even with high event volume, and unlike many existing System Log event collectors, it doesn't require a third-party system to store an Okta Admin API token. See [Log Streaming API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/). <!--OKTA-578532-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is GA in Production

OAuth 2.0 Optional consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/main/). <!--OKTA-581292-->

#### OAuth 2.0 authentication for inline hooks is GA in Preview

Okta inline hook calls to third-party external web services previously provided only header-based authentication for security. Although sent with SSL, the header or custom header authentication didn't meet more stringent security requirements for various clients and industries.

To improve the security of inline hooks, Okta now supports authentication with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Tokens ensure secure calls to external web services.

When creating inline hooks in the Admin Console (or by API), administrators or developers can now select OAuth 2.0 authentication and choose between two methods of OAuth 2.0: Client Secret or Private Key. A new Key Management API and Admin Console page is also available to create public/private key pairs for use with OAuth 2.0 inline hooks. See [Key management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-key-management).

Using the OAuth 2.0 framework provides better security than Basic Authentication or custom headers, and is less work than setting up an IP allowlisting solution. Clients also have the ability to use access tokens minted by their own custom authorization servers to guarantee that Okta is calling their client web services and isn't triggered by any external actors. See [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook). <!--OKTA-581803-->

#### Improvements to self-service account activities for AD and LDAP users

Previously, the self-service unlock (SSU) and self-service password reset (SSPR) flows created unnecessary friction for AD and LDAP users. This feature enhancement introduces a seamless magic link experience in emails sent to unlock accounts and reset passwords. Users no longer need to provide consent when using the same browser. In addition, after successfully unlocking their account, clicking the email magic link counts towards the application's assurance policy. After the assurance requirements are met, the user is signed directly in to the application. These improvements are now GA in Preview. See [Customize email notifications](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#use-vtl-variables). <!--OKTA-584526-->

#### Honor force authentication support for SAML Apps API

Previously, the **Honor Force Authentication** parameter (`honorForceAuthn`) could only be set from the [SAML 2.0 App Integration Wizard](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-apps-aiw-saml). When this property is set to `true`, users are prompted for their credentials when a SAML request has the `ForceAuthn` attribute set to `true`. You can now set this property for your SAML app without using the app integration wizard. See the [SAML 2.0 settings parameters in the Apps API](/docs/reference/api/apps/#add-saml-2-0-authentication-application). <!--OKTA-550077-->

#### OIN Manager support for Workflow Connector submission is GA in Preview

Okta [Workflows](https://www.okta.com/platform/workflows/) is a no-code, if-this-then-that logic builder that Okta orgs can use to automate custom or complex employee onboarding and offboarding flows in your application. You can now publish Workflow connectors that you create with the [Workflows Connector Builder](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=wf&id=ext-connector-builder) in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) catalog. Publishing a Workflows connector with Okta allows your customers to deeply integrate your product with all other connectors in the catalog. Submit your Workflow connector by using the OIN Manager. See [Submit an integration](/docs/guides/submit-app/wfconnector/main/#submit-an-integration) for Workflows connectors. <!--OKTA-571943 & OKTA-573202-->

#### Rate limit increased for Event Hooks

The number of events that can be delivered to Event Hooks is now 400,000 events per org, per day. See [Rate limits](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#rate-limits). <!--OKTA-573847-->

#### Bug fixed in 2023.03.0

When an admin used a group limit in an expression that was greater than 100 (for example, `Groups.startsWith("active_directory","",500)` ), /userinfo endpoint requests failed. (OKTA-576414)

#### Allowlist for FIDO2 (WebAuthn) authenticators is Self-Service EA in Preview

Okta now enables you to manage which FIDO2 WebAuthn authenticators are allowed in your org for new enrollments. This feature allows you to create an allow list of specific FIDO2 WebAuthn authenticators (based on FIDO Metadata Service) that can be used in enrollment policies. This allows admins to have greater control over which authenticators may be used in their orgs and determine which users may access them in a granular way.  See `settings.authenticators.constraints` in the `MFA_ENROLL` [Policies API](/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-authenticator-object). <!--OKTA-559662-->

#### Applications API support for SAML metadata attributes

The Applications API now supports metadata dynamic SAML attributes inherited from the SAML app. The SAML attributes are used to manage configured group attributes.The Admin Console displays the dynamic SAML attributes as **Configure SAML Attributes**, and the API returns these attributes as the `settings.signOn.configuredAttributeStatements` property in the [SAML application object](/docs/reference/api/apps/#add-saml-2-0-authentication-application). <!--OKTA-573057,OKTA-549695-->

#### Authenticator enrollment using the /authorize endpoint is GA in Preview

Authenticator enrollment provides a standardized way for a user to enroll a new authenticator using the OAuth `/authorize` endpoint. This feature uses query parameters such as prompt and `enroll_amr_values` to specify which authenticator the user wants to enroll. It also automatically verifies at least two factors as long the user has already enrolled two or more factors. <!--OKTA-572026-->

#### Custom app login is GA in Production

Custom app login is now available to limited customers in Identity Engine. Only orgs that actively used this feature in Classic Engine before they upgraded may continue to do so. Orgs that don't use custom app login should continue to use the [Okta-hosted sign-in experience](/docs/guides/redirect-authentication/) or [configure IdP routing rules](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-cfg-routing-rules) that redirect users to the appropriate app to sign in. <!--OKTA-561569-->

#### Factors API support for Okta Verify authenticator enrollment flows is GA in Production

Identity Engine now supports Okta Verify enrollments with email or SMS links created from the Factors API. Previously, when a client generated an Okta Verify enrollment email or SMS link using the Factors API, the enrollment from the Okta Verify app failed with an `Invalid Token` error. To address this issue, Factors API updates include the following behaviors when the Okta Verify authenticator is used:

* When an Okta Verify enrollment request is made using the Factors API for a user not currently enrolled with an Okta Verify factor, then all three `signed_nonce`, `push`, and `totp` factors are enrolled.
* The GET factors operation lists all Okta Verify enrollment methods for a user.
* The DELETE `push` or `signed_nonce` factor operation deletes all three factor enrollments (`push`, `signed_nonce`, and `totp`).

See [Enroll Okta Verify Push](/docs/reference/api/factors/#enroll-okta-verify-push-factor) and [Reset Factor](/docs/reference/api/factors/#reset-factor) updates in the Factors API. <!--OKTA-568807-->

#### Full-featured code editor is GA in Production

The full-featured code editor makes editing code for the sign-in page, email templates, and error pages more efficient and less reliant on documentation. Developers can write, test, and publish code faster with syntax highlighting, autocomplete for variables, split versus unified diff views, and **Revert**, **Preview**, and **Publish** buttons. See [Use the code editor](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#use-the-code-editor). <!--OKTA-568606-->

#### Log Streaming is GA in Preview

Many organizations use third-party systems to monitor, aggregate, and act on the event data in Okta System Log events.

Log Streaming enables Okta admins to more easily and securely send System Log events to a specified systems, such as the Splunk Cloud or Amazon Eventbridge, in near real time with simple, pre-built connectors. Log streaming scales well even with high event volume, and unlike many existing System Log event collectors, it doesn't require a third-party system to store an Okta Admin API token. See [Log Streaming API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/). <!--OKTA-565478-->

#### Multibrand customizations are EA in Preview

Multibrand customizations allow customers to use one org to manage multiple brands and multiple custom domains. This drastically simplifies multi-tenant architectures where customers create multiple orgs to satisfy branding requirements. Multibrand customizations allow orgs to create up to three custom domains (more upon request), which can be mapped to multiple sign-in pages, multiple sets of emails, error pages, and multiple versions of the End-User Dashboard. See [Brands](/docs/concepts/brands/). <!--OKTA-568831, OKTA-568807-->

#### OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/). <!--OKTA-572343-->

#### OIDC Identity Providers private/public key pair support is GA in Preview

Previously, Okta only supported the use of client secret as the client authentication method with an OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider. Okta now supports the use of private/public key pairs (`private_key_jwt`) with OpenID Connect-based Identity Providers. Additionally, the Signed Request Object now also supports the use of private/public key pairs. See [Create an Identity Provider in Okta](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!--OKTA-573913-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is GA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/). <!--OKTA-571987-->

#### Smart Card authenticator is Self-Service EA in Preview

You can add a new Smart Card authenticator that enables PIV to be used in authentication policies. You can also restrict the authentication policies to use only Smart Card authenticator as MFA. See `properties.additionalAmr` in the updated [Identity Provider attributes](/docs/reference/api/idps/#identity-provider-attributes) for `X509` Smart Card support. <!--OKTA-565169, OKTA-565875-->

#### Splunk edition support for Log Streaming integrations is GA in Preview

The Spunk Cloud Log Streaming integration now supports GCP and GovCloud customers. You can set the Splunk edition parameter (`settings.edition`) to AWS (`aws`), GCP (`gcp`), or AWS GovCloud (`aws_govcloud`) in your Log Streaming integration. See [Splunk Cloud Settings properties](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/#tag/LogStream/operation/createLogStream!path=1/settings&t=request). <!--OKTA-544449-->

#### Updated AWS EventBridge supported regions for Log Stream integrations

The list of supported AWS EventBridge regions has been updated based on configurable event sources. See the [list of available AWS regions for Log Stream integrations](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/#tag/LogStream/operation/createLogStream!path=0/settings/region&t=request). <!--OKTA-573094-->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2023.02.0

* The Okta Developer portal has a new look and feel. The [home page](https://developer.okta.com/) features a curated set of resources on developer use cases for Workforce Identity Cloud solutions. You can also access the featured blog posts to stay up to date with implementing Okta features.

* A new authorization guide is available to help admins and devs retain the user context in requests to downstream services. This document  provides guidance on how a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/).

* A new requirements guide is available for integration submissions to the Okta Integration Network (OIN). This document provides guidance for the artifacts required during the submission process, such as the logo, the customer configuration document, and the test account. See [OIN submission requirements](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/).

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.02.0

* GET requests to the `/brands/{brandId}` endpoint didn't return the previously saved `agreeToCustomPrivacyPolicy`. (OKTA-568074)

* GET requests to the `/brands/{brandId}/pages/sign-in/customized` endpoint returned `null` for `widgetCustomizations`. As a result, the updates weren't applied to the Okta Admin Console sign-in page. (OKTA-563838)

* The Add Group API (`/api/v1/groups`) created multiple groups of the same name if called within a short period of time (milliseconds). (OKTA-561481)

* The response took longer than necessary when an admin sent a request to delete an OpenID Connect app. (OKTA-531089)

* The Roles API (`/iam/roles`) didn't support the self and next link relation types. (OKTA-512280)

* Some custom admins didn't see groups and users that they had access to when they made a `GET` request to the Users (`/users/{id}/groups`) and Groups (`/groups/{id}/users`) APIs. (OKTA-568838)

* Users created using Just-In-Time provisioning weren't assigned to a group when a group rule existed. (OKTA-532840)

* An unclear error message was returned when a group rules API call (`create`, `update`, or `activate`) was made to assign users to read-only groups (for example, `Everyone`). (OKTA-567972)

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.1

* Requests failed when an admin used a group limit in an expression that was more than 100 (for example, `getFilteredGroups(groupallowlist, group_expression, 101)`). (OKTA-565041)

* Requests failed when an admin used a group limit in an expression that was less than the number of groups that satisfied the request (for example, `Groups.startsWith("active_directory","eai_",10)`). (OKTA-556056)

* The `idp` property was missing in token inline hook requests. (OKTA-553322)

* A list security questions request (`/users/${userId}/factors/questions`) resulted in an unexpected security question and answer included in the response. (OKTA-567970)

* Users could request that one-time passwords for SMS, Voice, and Email activation be resent more times than allowed by the rate limit. (OKTA-550739)

#### Custom app login

Custom app login is now available to limited customers in Identity Engine. Only orgs that actively used this feature in Classic Engine before they upgraded may continue to do so. Orgs that don't use custom app login should continue to use the [Okta-hosted sign-in experience](/docs/guides/redirect-authentication/) or [configure IdP routing rules](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-cfg-routing-rules) that redirect users to the appropriate app to sign in. <!-- OKTA-564039-->

#### Full regional support for AWS EventBridge Log Stream integrations is EA in Preview

The Log Streaming API has expanded support for all commercial regions in the AWS EventBridge Log Stream integration. See [AWS EventBridge Setting property details](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/#tag/LogStream/operation/createLogStream!path=0/settings/region&t=request). <!-- OKTA-540378-->

#### Improvements to self-service account activities for AD and LDAP users

Previously, the self-service unlock (SSU) and self-service password reset (SSPR) flows created unnecessary friction for AD and LDAP users. This feature enhancement introduces a seamless magic link experience in emails sent to unlock accounts and reset passwords. Users no longer need to provide consent when using the same browser. In addition, after successfully unlocking their account, clicking the email magic link counts towards the application's assurance policy. After the assurance requirements are met, the user is signed directly in to the application. These improvements are now GA in Preview. See [Customize email notifications](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#use-vtl-variables). <!-- OKTA-561486-->

#### Improvements to the self-service registration experience

Earlier versions of the self-service registration (SSR) flow used a complicated array of templates to send activation emails to users. The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the user's email address, use the **Registration - Activation** template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification is not immediately required to sign in to the application, use the **Registration - Email Verification** template. This template includes a link for users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application. See [Customize email notifications](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/) and the [Okta email (magic link/OTP) integration guide](/docs/guides/authenticators-okta-email/aspnet/main/). <!-- OKTA-497136 & 499523-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/). <!-- OKTA-563884-->

#### Revoke user sessions is GA in Production

You can end all Okta sessions for a user when resetting their password. All sessions of the specified user are revoked except for the current session. This option protects the user account from unauthorized access. See the `revokeSession` parameter in the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/#change-password). <!-- OKTA-542646-->

#### Unusual telephony requests blocked by machine-learning measures

SMS and voice requests are now blocked if an internal machine-learning-based toll fraud and abuse-detection model considers the requests unusual. Telephony requests that are blocked by the machine-learning model have a `DENY` status in the System Log. <!-- OKTA-562110-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.0

* The Log Streaming API returned the Splunk Cloud `token` property in the response body. (OKTA-437264)

* When an org had the Custom OTP, RSA SecurID, and YubiKey authenticators enabled and the `enroll_amr_values` parameter value was `otp`, users were prompted to enroll in all three authenticators rather than just Custom OTP. (OKTA-545674)
