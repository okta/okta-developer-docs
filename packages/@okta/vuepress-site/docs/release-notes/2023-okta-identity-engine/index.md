#### Custom app login

Custom app login is now available to limited customers in Identity Engine. Only orgs that actively used the feature in Classic Engine before they upgraded may continue to do so. Orgs that don't use custom app login should continue to use the [Okta-hosted sign-in experience](/docs/guides/redirect-authentication/) or [configure IdP routing rules](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-cfg-routing-rules) that redirect users to the appropriate app to sign in. <!-- OKTA-564039-->

#### Full regional support for AWS EventBridge Log Stream integrations is EA on Preview

The Log Streaming API has expanded support for all commercial regions in the AWS EventBridge Log Stream integration. See [AWS EventBridge Setting property details](/docs/reference/api/log-streaming/#property-details-2). <!-- OKTA-540378-->

#### Improvements to self-service account activities for AD and LDAP users

Previously, the self-service unlock (SSU) and self-service password reset (SSPR) flows created unnecessary friction for AD and LDAP users. This feature enhancement introduces a seamless magic link experience in emails sent to unlock accounts and reset passwords. Users no longer need to provide consent when using the same browser. In addition, after successfully unlocking their account, clicking the email magic link counts towards the application's assurance policy. After the assurance requirements are met, the user is signed directly in to the application. These improvements are now GA in Preview. See [Customize email notifications](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#use-vtl-variables). <!-- OKTA-561486-->

#### Improvements to the self-service registration experience

Earlier versions of the self-service registration (SSR) flow used a complicated array of templates to send activation emails to users. The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the user’s email address, use the **Registration - Activation** template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification is not immediately required to sign in to the application, use the **Registration - Email Verification** template. This template includes a link for users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application. See [Customize email notifications](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/) and the [Okta email (magic link/OTP) integration guide](/docs/guides/authenticators-okta-email/aspnet/main/). <!-- OKTA-497136 & 499523-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/). <!-- OKTA-563884-->

#### Revoke user sessions is GA in Production

You can end all Okta sessions for a user when resetting their password. All sessions of the specified user are revoked except for the current session. This option protects the user account from unauthorized access. See the `revokeSession` parameter in the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/#change-password). <!-- OKTA-542646-->

#### Unusual telephony requests blocked by machine-learning measures

SMS and voice requests are now blocked if an internal machine-learning-based toll fraud and abuse-detection model considers the requests unusual. Telephony requests that are blocked by the machine-learning model have a `DENY` status in the System Log. <!-- OKTA-562110-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.0

* A list security questions request (`/users/&{userId}/factors/questions`) resulted in an unexpected question and error in the response. (OKTA-525478)

* When an org had the Custom OTP, RSA SecurID, and YubiKey authenticators enabled and the `enroll_amr_values` parameter value was `otp`, users were prompted to enroll in all three authenticators rather than just Custom OTP. (OKTA-545674)

* The Log Streaming API returned the Splunk Cloud `token` property in the response body. (OKTA-437264)
