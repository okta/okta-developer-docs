### Bugs fixed in 2020.09.4

* When an OAuth service client called the `/authorize` [endpoint](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#authorize), the returned error description was inaccurate. (OKTA-252750)

* If a user was assigned to two groups that have identical roles, then a call to the `/users/${userId}/roles` endpoint to [list the administrator roles assigned](/docs/reference/api/roles/#list-roles) to the user failed with an HTTP 400 error. (OKTA-325187)

* The `okta.apps.*` scope wasn't applied to the [`/apps/${applicationId}/credentials/keys`](/docs/reference/api/apps/#list-key-credentials-for-application) endpoint. (OKTA-331828)
