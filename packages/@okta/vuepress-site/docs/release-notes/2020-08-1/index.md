### Bugs fixed in 2020.08.2

* In orgs with Factor Sequencing enabled, customers always had `password` as one of the factor types in the ID token's `amr` claim, regardless of which factor was actually used. (OKTA-318437)
* For some orgs with both Passwordless Authentication and Improved New Device Behavior Detection enabled, Okta treated all authentication attempts as though they came from new devices. (OKTA-320675)
