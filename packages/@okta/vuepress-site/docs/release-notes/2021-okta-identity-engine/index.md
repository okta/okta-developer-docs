#### Brands API support for auto-detecting contrast colors

The Brands API [Theme object properties](/docs/reference/api/brands/#theme-api-objects) `primaryColorContrastHex` and `secondaryColorContrastHex` automatically optimize the contrast between font color and the background or button color. The auto-detection feature can be disabled by updating either property value with an accepted contrast hex value.<!--OKTA-426715-->

#### New Devices API response property available

Calls to the [List devices](/docs/reference/api/devices/#usage-example-expand-user) endpoint with an `expand=user` query now return the management status associated with each embedded user.<!--OKTA-431007-->

#### New error page macros for themed templates

Custom [error page templates](/docs/guides/custom-error-pages/use-macros/) include new macros to customize the URL (href) in addition to the button text for themed templates.<!--OKTA-440888-->

#### Token-based SSO between native apps is now GA in Production

Single Sign-On (SSO) between browser-based web apps is achieved by leveraging shared cookies. Unlike web applications, native applications can't use web cookies. With Native SSO, Okta offers a token-based approach to achieve SSO between native applications.

Native SSO allows you to protect native OpenID Connect applications, such as desktop apps and mobile apps, and achive SSO and Single Logout (SLO) between these applications. See [Configure SSO for native apps](/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/).<!--OKTA-435714-->
