#### New Devices API

The [Devices API](/docs/reference/api/devices/) allows you to retrieve a single device or a list of devices from an org. The API also allows you to activate, deactivate, suspend, unsuspend, and delete a device by ID. You can access the OAuth 2.0 supported Devices API by using the `okta.devices.manage` and `okta.devices.read` [scopes](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/scopes/). <!--OKTA-424362-->

[Policy Authenticator](/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-authenticator-object) configurations are now included in the Policy API's [Multifactor (MFA) Enrollment Policy](/docs/reference/api/policy/#multifactor-mfa-enrollment-policy) settings. You can configure either [Authenticators](/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-authenticators-settings-example) or [Factors](/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-factors-settings-example) for an MFA Enrollment Policy with this API update. The Policy Authenticator configurations are available for all active Authenticators, including enrollment and recovery Authenticators. <!--OKTA-429994-->
