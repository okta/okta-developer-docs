### New Device Notification Emails are Generally Available (GA)

When enabled, end users will receive a new device notification email when signing in to Okta from a new or unrecognized device. This feature is now generally available to all orgs. For more information about email notifications, refer to the New or Unknown Device Notification Emails section on [this page](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/Security_General.htm). <!--OKTA-186366-->

### Email Rate Limiting

Okta is introducing new rate limits for emails that are sent to users. This will help with service protection. <!--OKTA-186424-->

### New sendEmail Parameter for User Deletion and Deactivation

User deletion and deactivation requests now have an optional `sendEmail` parameter. For more information see the documentation for those endpoints:

* [DELETE /api/v1/apps/${applicationId}/users/${userId}](/docs/api/resources/apps/#remove-user-from-application)
* [DELETE /api/v1/users/${userId}](/docs/api/resources/users/#delete-user)
* [POST /api/v1/users/${userId}/lifecycle/deactivate](/docs/api/resources/users/#deactivate-user)

<!--OKTA-185729-->

### Support for JWTs Signed with Private Keys

Requests to the `/token` and `/authorize` endpoints will now accept JWTs signed with a private key. For more information see the OIDC documentation for the [token endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#token) and the [authorize endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#authorize). <!--OKTA-181514 + OKTA-186410-->

### System Log Event for Rate Limit Override Expiration

A System Log event will be generated exactly two days before a temporary API rate limit override is set to expire. The limit's expiration is set by customer support based on a window agreed upon when the override was requested. Once a limit has expired, it will no longer take effect and the customer will be subject to the [default limit for that API endpoint](/docs/api/getting_started/rate-limits). <!--OKTA-173997-->

### Required Properties in App User Schema

API calls to [modify an app user schema](/docs/api/resources/schemas/#update-app-user-profile-schema-property) can no longer change the nullability (`required` field) of a property if that property is shown as required in the default predefined schema for that app. <!--OKTA-177449-->
