### ID Tokens Can Be Refreshed

OpenID Connect ID tokens can now be retrieved using a refresh token. For more information, see our [Open ID Connect Reference](/docs/reference/api/oidc/).

### Custom URL Domains are in Early Access

You can customize your Okta org by replacing the Okta domain name with a custom URL domain name that you specify. For example, if the URL of your Okta org is `https://${yourOktaDomain}`, you can configure a custom URL for the org such as `https://id.example.com`. For details, see the [Configure a custom URL domain](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_custom_url_domain).

### Custom Okta-hosted Sign-In Page is in Early Access

You can customize the text and the look and feel of the Okta-hosted sign-in page using form controls and an embedded HTML editor. When used together with [custom URL domain](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_custom_url_domain) (required) and [custom Okta-hosted error page](/docs/guides/custom-error-pages/overview/), this feature offers a fully customized end-user sign-in experience hosted by Okta. For details, see [Configure a custom Okta-hosted sign-in page](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-okta-hosted/).

### Custom Error Page is in Early Access

You can customize the text and the look and feel of error pages using an embedded HTML editor. When used together with [custom URL domain](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_custom_url_domain) (required) and [custom Okta-hosted sign-in page](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-okta-hosted/), this feature offers a fully customized error page. For details, see [Configure a custom error page](/docs/guides/custom-error-pages/overview/).

### Bugs Fixed in 2018.19

* Delays were experienced when deleting users. As a result of the fix, one will notice a period of time between when the deletion was initiated and when it completes.  During the period, the user will still be visible, but the deletion cannot be reversed. (OKTA-157884)

* OAuth 2.0 and OIDC requests made with redirect URLs that contained underscores in the domain name would result in an error. (OKTA-167483)
