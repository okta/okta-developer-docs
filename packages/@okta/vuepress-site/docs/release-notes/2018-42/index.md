### Bugs Fixed in 2018.42

* The `/clients` [endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oauth-clients#list-client-applications) dropped the `filter` parameter for any paginated results returned after the first page.
* Messages that were sent to devices using the [Factors API](/docs/api/resources/factors) would sometimes return a `500` error if the message could not be sent.
