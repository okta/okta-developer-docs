* `createdBy` and `lastUpdatedBy` custom attributes couldn't be used in group rules. (OKTA-566492)

* Custom admins who were limited to viewing only application group members received incomplete results when using the `List All Users API` without a `search` or `filter` parameter. (OKTA-801592)

* The JSON Web Token that Okta generates and sends to the OpenID Connect identity provider contained a string `exp` instead of a number 'exp'. (OKTA-852446)

* When making `POST` requests to `users/{userId}/factors/{factorId}/verify` or `authn/factors/{factorId}/verify` endpoints with `factorType` instead of `factorId` in the URL path, multiple failed verification attempts didn't lock users out and the failed attempts weren't logged in the System Log.

#### OIDC IdPs now support group sync is GA in Production

OpenID Connect identity providers (IdPs) now support full group sync and adding a user to a group that they don't already belong to. A user who authenticates with an external IdP is added to all available groups when **Full sync of groups** is enabled. The user is added to any groups that they don't already belong to when **Add user to missing groups** is enabled. This allows you to specify certain groups that users should be added to. <!-- GROUP_SYNC_FEATURE_OIDC_IDP_ENABLED (https://oktainc.atlassian.net/browse/OKTA-817450#icft=OKTA-817450) -->

#### Granular account linking for certain Identity Providers is GA in Production

When admins link users from SAML and OIDC identity providers, they can now exclude specific users and admins. This improves security by allowing admins to configure granular access control scenarios. See **Add an external Identity Provider** for [OpenId Connect](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta) and [SAML 2.0](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/saml2/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!-- EXTENDED_ACCOUNT_LINKING_FILTERS OKTA-831244-->

#### Improved group search functionality is GA in Production

You can now search for groups whose names or descriptions contain specified text. This makes it easier to find a group when you don't recall its exact name. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter of the Groups API. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators) and [`search` within the Groups API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!in=query&path=search&t=request).<!--OKTA-862579 DIRECTORY_SERVICE_GROUP_CONTAINS_SEARCH-->

#### Improved user search functionality is GA in Production

You can now search for users whose names, email addresses, or usernames contain specified text. This makes it easier to do user lookups and add users to groups. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter of the Users API. See [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators) and [`search` within the Users API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers!in=query&path=search&t=request). <!--OKTA-862577 DIRECTORY_SERVICE_USER_CONTAINS_SEARCH-->

#### Improved realms and device search functionality is GA in Production

We've extended the contains (`co`) operator to realms and devices. You can now search for realms and devices whose profile attributes contain specified text through API. This makes lookups easier without needing to recall the exact names of various profile attributes. Use the `co` operator within the `search` parameter. See [Contains operator](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#contains-operator) and the `search` parameter in the [Realms](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Realm/#tag/Realm/operation/listRealms!in=query&path=search&t=request) and [Devices](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Device/#tag/Device/operation/listDevices!in=query&path=search&t=request) APIs.  
<!-- OKTA-865940 -->

#### Realms for Workforce is GA in Production

The Realms and Realms Management APIs allow you to unlock greater flexibility in managing and delegating the management of your distinct user populations within a single Okta org. See [Realms](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Realm/) and [Realm Assignments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RealmAssignment/).   <!--- https://oktainc.atlassian.net/browse/OKTA-853176#icft=OKTA-853176 UD_REALMS_FOUNDATIONS and UD_REALMS -->

#### Advanced search using conditioned profile attributes

If you have an admin role with permission conditions to access certain user profile attributes, you can now search for those users with those attributes. Note that this search enhancement doesn't support the `OR` operator. <!-- OKTA-856262 -->

#### Identity Security Posture Management functionality in the OIN catalog

The **Okta Integration Network** page now provides **Identity Security Posture Management** functionality. When you select it, the OIN catalog displays only the apps with Identity Security Posture Management functionality.

#### Default global session policy rule update

The default value for the `maxSessionLifetimeMinutes` property of the default global session policy rule is now `1440` (24 hours) and can be changed. Previously the `maxSessionLifetimeMinutes` property of the default global session policy rule was read-only.
See [Policies API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Policy/#tag/Policy/operation/createPolicyRule!path=3/actions/signon/session/maxSessionLifetimeMinutes&t=request).

#### Developer documentation update in 2025.03.0

The list of public permissions has moved from the [Roles in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#permissions) topic to the [Permissions in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/permissions) topic. The new topic contains more permission details for you to define your custom admin roles. <!--OKTA-857969--> 

#### Bug fixed in 2025.03.0

Some certificates with trailing characters were uploaded successfully to the `/domains/{domainId}/certificate` endpoint, despite their invalid format. (OKTA-486406)

#### IP Exempt Zone is GA in Preview

This feature introduces `useAsExemptList` as a read-only Boolean property that distinguishes the new default IP exempt zones from other zones. When you enable this feature and you make a GET `api/v1/zones` request, Okta returns `useAsExemptList` in the response. The value `true` indicates that the zone is an exempt zone. Only system generated exempt zones are available. <!-- DEFAULT_NETWORK_ZONE_IP_EXEMPT_LIST (OKTA-795812: Parent Jira for DEFAULT_NETWORK_ZONE_IP_EXEMPT_LIST GA Preview) -->

#### OIDC IdPs now support group sync is GA in Preview

OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers (IdPs) now support full group sync and adding a user to a group that they don't already belong to. A user who authenticates with an external IdP is added to all available groups when **Full sync of groups** is enabled. The user is added to any groups that they don't already belong to when **Add user to missing groups** is enabled. This allows you to specify certain groups that users should be added to. <!-- GROUP_SYNC_FEATURE_OIDC_IDP_ENABLED (OKTA-817450: FVM for EA Self-Service GROUP_SYNC_FEATURE_OIDC_IDP_ENABLED for Weekly Release 2024.10.1 Resolved) -->

#### Granular account linking for certain identity providers is GA

When admins link users from SAML and OIDC identity providers, they can now exclude specific users and admins. This improves security by allowing admins to configure granular access control scenarios. See **Add an external Identity Provider** for [OpenID Connect](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta) and [SAML 2.0](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/saml2/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!-- EXTENDED_ACCOUNT_LINKING_FILTERS OKTA-831244-->

#### Support for importing Active Directory group descriptions is GA in Production

The descriptions of groups sourced from Active Directory now use their description from AD. These replace any previous descriptions of AD-sourced groups in Okta, which used a pretty-printed version of the distinguished name (DN) instead.<!-- FF IMPORT_AD_GROUP_DESCRIPTION OKTA-863277 -->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2025.02.0

| [Bugs fixed in 2025.01.2](#bugs-fixed-in-2025-01-2) | January 29, 2025 |

#### Authentication claims sharing between Okta orgs is EA in Preview

Authentication claims sharing allows an admin to configure their Okta org to trust claims from IdPs during SSO. Sharing claims also allows Okta to interpret the authentication context from an IdP. This helps eliminate duplicate factor challenges during user authentication and helps improve security posture. See [Configure claims sharing](/docs/guides/configure-claims-sharing/oktasaml/main/).<!-- ORG2ORG_CLAIMS_SHARING OKTA-856733 -->

#### Bugs fixed in 2025.01.2

* When the Default Network Zone IP Exempt List feature was enabled for an org, an admin was able to delete the default example IP zone using the Zones API (`/api/v1/zones/{DefaultExemptIpZone ID}`). (OKTA-817263)
* The [List all principal rate limits](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/PrincipalRateLimit/#tag/PrincipalRateLimit/operation/listPrincipalRateLimitEntities) returned an empty response when querying with a custom `client_id` and using OAuth 2.0 for authentication.  (OKTA-832687)
* When a super admin updated a deactivated user to a different realm, admins received a `Resource not found` error. (OKTA-699778)
* Events for tokens revoked in bulk for a resource didn't appear in the System Log. (OKTA-834025)

See [OIN Wizard use case selection](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#oin-wizard-use-case-selection). <!-- OKTA-843778 -->

#### Deprecated API endpoints: Extend, Grant, and Revoke Okta Support access

The following API endpoints have been deprecated:

* [Extend Okta Support access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/OrgSettingSupport/#tag/OrgSettingSupport/operation/extendOktaSupport) (`POST /api/v1/org/privacy/oktaSupport/extend`)
* [Grant Okta Support access](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/OrgSettingSupport/#tag/OrgSettingSupport/operation/grantOktaSupport) (`POST /api/v1/org/privacy/oktaSupport/grant`)

#### Granular configuration for Keep Me Signed In is EA in Preview

Admins can now configure the post-authentication prompt for Keep Me Signed In (KMSI) at a granular level in authentication policies. This allows admins to selectively enable post-authentication KMSI on a per-user, per-group, or per-app basis. When enabled, this feature exposes a frequency setting that lets admins control how often the post-authentication prompt is presented to users. See [Configure Keep me signed in (KMSI)](/docs/guides/keep-me-signed-in/main/).

The post-authentication prompt text (title, subtitle, accept button, and reject button) is now customizable through the Brands API. See [Customize post-authentication sign-in prompts](/docs/guides/keep-me-signed-in/main/#customize-post-authentication-sign-in-prompts). <!-- POST_AUTH_KMSI_IN_AUTH_POLICY OKTA-791596 -->

#### POST requests to the authorize endpoint is Self-Service EA

You can now send user data securely in a POST request body to the /authorize endpoint. <!-- https://oktainc.atlassian.net/browse/OKTA-827104#icft=OKTA-827104 FF: OAUTH2_AUTHORIZE_WITH_POST -->
