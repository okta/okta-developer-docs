#### Manage email subscription settings using the Subscriptions API

The `/subscriptions` API is now available in Self-Service EA. The [Subscriptions API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Subscription/) provides operations to manage email subscription settings for Okta administrator notifications. <!--OKTA-325794-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2020.12.2

* Clients making GET requests to `/api/v1/users/{usernameprefix}` received an error if the user's [short name](/docs/reference/api/users/#get-user-with-login-shortname) (`usernameprefix`) ended with `.jpg`, `.png`, `.js`, `.css`, or a similar file extension, even when a user matching that short name existed. (OKTA-322140)
* When an [MFA policy](/docs/reference/api/policy/#multifactor-mfa-enrollment-policy) was created without specifying the `consent` format, subsequent GET and UPDATE requests resulted in an error. (OKTA-339250)
* The `/users/${userId}/groups` endpoint incorrectly returned a 500 Internal Server Error if the last page contained no elements. (OKTA-358328)

#### Inclusive language and terminology

Okta is focused on the adoption of inclusive language and communication. Some long-standing industry terminology and expressions have been updated in this release. More updates will be made in future releases.

In this release, the documentation for Custom Groups Claims has been updated with inclusive terminology. The term "whitelist" has been replaced with "allowlist":

- [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a dynamic allowlist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-dynamic/main/#add-a-groups-claim-with-a-dynamic-allow-list)

- [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a static allowlist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-dynamic/main/#use-a-dynamic-group-allow-list-with-the-org-authorization-server)

Existing custom claims that use the `groupwhitelist` Profile property don't need to change.<!--OKTA-344317-->

#### New OAuth Administrator Roles API scopes

The [Administer Roles API](/docs/reference/api/roles) now supports OAuth scopes `okta.roles.manage` and `okta.roles.read`. These scopes allow applications to read and manage (create, update, and delete) administrator roles in your Okta organization.<!--OKTA-287229-->

#### New endpoint added to DynamicScale rate limits

The [DynamicScale](/docs/reference/rl-dynamic-scale/) add-on service now includes the following additional authentication endpoint: `/login/login.html`.<!--OKTA-342112-->

#### Account linking for SAML IdPs is now GA in Production

Admins can now enable or disable automatic account linking between SAML Identity Providers and Okta using the [Identity Provider API](/docs/reference/api/idps/). They can also restrict account linking based on whether the end user is a member of any specified groups. <!--OKTA-334889-->

#### One Time Use Refresh Token is now in Early Access (EA)

One Time Use Refresh Token, also called Refresh Token Rotation, is now in Early Access. Refresh Token Rotation helps a public client to securely rotate refresh tokens after each use. A new refresh token is returned each time the client makes a request to exchange a refresh token for a new access token. See [Refresh Token Rotation](/docs/guides/refresh-tokens/main/#refresh-token-rotation).<!--OKTA-345754-->

#### Enhancements to Apps API for Idp Initiated Logins

The [Apps API](/docs/reference/api/apps/) can now configure the Idp Initiated Login behavior, which is also available in the Admin Console. **Note:** The Idp Initiated Login is limited to OpenID Connect clients. <!--OKTA-342821-->

#### Enhancements to Apps API for SAML Apps

The [Apps API](/docs/reference/api/apps/) can now configure the SLO URL behavior for SAML apps, which is also available in the Admin Console.<!--OKTA-342882-->

#### Groups API extended search is now GA in Preview

The Groups API support for extended search is now Generally Available (GA) in Preview.<!--OKTA-344169-->

| [Bugs Fixed in 2020.11.1](#bugs-fixed-in-2020-11-1) | November 11, 2020         |

#### Bugs fixed in 2020.11.1

* Import of users with a [bcrypt-hashed password](/docs/reference/api/users/#hashed-password-object) succeeded even if the `workFactor` property was missing or misnamed. This prevented imported users from signing in. (OKTA-330587)
* During user import, some POST requests to the `/users` [endpoint](/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user) incorrectly triggered inline hooks, resulting in higher latency. (OKTA-335769)

| [Bug Fixed in 2020.11.0](#bug-fixed-in-2020-11-0) | November 4, 2020        |

#### Inclusive language and terminology

Okta is focused on the adoption of inclusive language and communication. Some long-standing industry terminology and expressions have been updated in this release. More updates will be made in future releases.

The descriptive information returned on both the invalid redirect URI and invalid logout URI error pages has been updated to remove the term "whitelisted". <!--OKTA-336922-->

#### System Log API adds additional filter expressions

The [System Log API](/docs/reference/api/system-log/) `/logs` endpoint can now use the SCIM filter expression operators: `ew` (ends with), `ne` (not equal), and `not` (not function). <!--OKTA-188737-->

#### Zones API includes `usage` property

To help you manage zones in your organization, the Early Access [Zones API](/docs/reference/api/zones/) now includes the `usage` attribute. There are two types of zones: Policy Network Zones and Blocklist Network Zones. <!--OKTA-333653-->

#### Client-based rate limiting is now GA in Production

[Client-based rate limiting](/docs/reference/rl-clientbased/) for the `/authorize` endpoint is now available in production orgs. It provides granular isolation between requests made to the `/authorize` endpoint by using a combination of the Client ID, user's IP address, and Okta device identifier. This isolates rogue OAuth clients and bad actors, ensuring valid users and applications don't run into rate limit violations.

This feature will be available to orgs in Okta Production cells on November 9, 2020. <!--OKTA-342520-->

#### User Consent for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows is rolling out to GA in Production

A consent represents a user's explicit permission to allow an application to access resources protected by scopes. As part of an OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect authentication flow, you can prompt the user with a page to approve your app's access to specified resources. See the [consent property for scopes](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/#scope-properties).

This feature will be gradually made available to orgs in Okta Production cells beginning on November 11, 2020.

#### Account linking for SAML IdPs is now GA in Preview

Admins can now enable or disable automatic account linking between SAML Identity Providers and Okta using the [Identity Provider API](/docs/reference/api/idps/). They can also restrict account linking based on whether the end user is a member of any specified groups. <!--OKTA-334818-->

#### Group object `source` property is now GA in Preview

For API requests that return a Group or a list of Groups, the Group object includes a `source` property that provides the ID of the source application for the returned Group. This property is now GA in all Preview orgs. See [Group attributes](/docs/reference/api/groups/#group-attributes). <!--OKTA-326610-->

#### MyAccount API is now in Early Access (EA)

The [MyAccount API](/docs/reference/api/myaccount/) enables non-administrator end users to fetch their Okta user profiles. To enable this EA feature, contact [Support](https://support.okta.com/help/open_case). <!--OKTA-342090-->

#### Bug fixed in 2020.11.0

When the `expiresAt` property value of the [Authentication transaction object](/docs/reference/api/authn/#authentication-transaction-object) was returned with an `/authn` [response](/docs/reference/api/authn/) that also included the `sessionToken` [parameter](/docs/reference/api/authn/#session-token) (not `stateToken`), the value incorrectly indicated a 3-minute lifetime. (OKTA-319907)

#### Bug fixed in 2020.10.2

#### Troubleshooting assistance for app redirect URI

When an app redirect URI is either missing or incorrectly configured, Okta returns an HTTP 400 error. Now, the error description provides troubleshooting assistance to debug the expected redirect URI. <!--OKTA-297932-->

#### API Access Management enables scope as a claim

You can now name a claim `scope` in API Access Management [custom authorization servers](/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/). Also, you can now use the EL expression `access.scope` in custom claims to return an array of granted scope strings. <!--OKTA-325243-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2020.09.4

* When an OAuth service client called the `/authorize` [endpoint](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#authorize), the returned error description was inaccurate. (OKTA-252750)

* If a user was assigned to two groups that have identical roles, then a call to the `/users/${userId}/roles` endpoint to [list the administrator roles assigned](/docs/reference/api/roles/#list-roles) to the user failed with an HTTP 400 error. (OKTA-325187)

* The `okta.apps.*` scope wasn't applied to the [`/apps/${applicationId}/credentials/keys`](/docs/reference/api/apps/#list-key-credentials-for-application) endpoint. (OKTA-331828)

#### Bug fixed in 2020.09.3

If a user was converted to use an [external Federated IdP instead of Okta](/docs/reference/api/users/#request-example-convert-a-user-to-a-federated-user), any subsequent attempt to convert the user with a call to the `/users/${userId}/lifecycle/reset_password` endpoint returned an HTTP 501 error instead of an HTTP 400 error. (OKTA-323343)


### Weekly Release 2020.09.2

#### Bug fixed in 2020.09.2

* Requests to the `/token`, `/revoke`, and `/introspect` endpoints that had invalid client credentials would return an HTTP 400 error instead of the HTTP 401 error required by the [OAuth 2.0 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). (OKTA-306444)

#### Bugs fixed in 2020.09.1

* If a `Groups` claim returned more than 100 groups, then tokens couldn't be minted, which generated an HTTP 500 error code instead of an HTTP 400 error code. (OKTA-321988)
* If an Identity Provider returned an error response during authentication, the `/introspect` endpoint returned an HTTP 500 error code. (OKTA-324419)

#### Password Import Event eligible for use in event hook

The `user.import.password` event provides information on the outcome of the import of an individual user's password during the [Password Import flow](/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook). This event is eligible for use in an [Event hook](/docs/concepts/event-hooks/), enabling you to trigger removal of a password from your existing user store when import to Okta is confirmed as successful. <!-- OKTA-298381 -->

#### OAuth public metadata endpoint caching

HTTP `no-cache` headers are no longer sent in responses returned by the following OAuth public metadata endpoints:

 * `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
 * `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
 * `/oauth2/{authorizationServerId}/.well-known/openid-configuration`
 * `/oauth2/{authorizationServerId}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
 <!-- OKTA-277596 -->
#### Improved new device behavior detection

When this feature is enabled, stronger signals are used for the detection of new devices. Devices with web browsers that don't store cookies are treated as new, and trusted applications must send a unique identifier for each device as a device token.  <!-- OKTA-297331 -->

#### Dynamic authentication context for SAML apps

You can configure a custom attribute statement for SAML assertions to send user authentication context to SAML apps during the app authentication process. Apps can use this information to limit access to certain app-specific behaviors and calculate the risk profile for the signed-in user. <!-- OKTA-297188 -->

#### New JWKS key length validation

New client JSON Web Key Sets are now validated and rejected if the key length is less than 2048 bits. <!-- OKTA-283603 -->

#### Password Import Inline Hook in General Availability in Preview and Production

The [password import inline hook](/docs/reference/password-hook/) lets you interface with an external service to verify a user-supplied password when the user signs in to Okta for the first time. This supports scenarios in which users are migrated from an existing user store while allowing them to retain their passwords. <!-- OKTA-275019 -->

#### OAuth for Okta Enabled for User Consent Grant Operations

[User Consent Grant Operations](/docs/reference/api/users/#user-consent-grant-operations) now have [OAuth for Okta](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/) enabled. <!--OKTA-254864-->

#### OAuth for Okta Enabled for Policy API

The [Policy API](/docs/reference/api/policy/) now has [OAuth for Okta](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/) enabled. <!--OKTA-272595-->

#### User Types API in General Availability in Preview

The [User Types API](/docs/reference/api/user-types/) is in General Availability (GA) in Preview. <!--OKTA-275379-->

#### SAML Assertion Inline Hook Now Supports URI Formatting in Claims

Okta now supports URI claims with the [SAML assertion inline hook](/docs/reference/saml-hook/). When you need to replace or add a URI claim, you must encode the claim name within the command based on the [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) specification. <!--OKTA-266619-->

#### Support Added in List Users API for Sort Parameters

The [List Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/#list-users) now supports `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters on `search` queries. <!--OKTA-270214-->

#### Apps API Support for Custom SAML Attribute Statements

The [Apps API](/docs/reference/api/apps/) now supports specifying SAML attribute statements for SAML 2.0 apps. <!--OKTA-275379-->

#### Rate Limits for OAuth 2.0 Endpoints in Production

[Rate limiting](/docs/reference/rate-limits/#okta-api-endpoints-and-per-minute-limits) has been modified for OAuth 2.0 endpoints in Production orgs so that requests that use an invalid client ID don't consume the rate limit. A System Log warning has also been introduced for high rate limit consumption by requests that use a valid client ID. <!--OKTA-27534-->

#### Bugs Fixed in 2020.02.0

* When using the [SAML assertion inline hook](/docs/reference/saml-hook/), if there was an optional attribute statement configured for the app and the attribute statement had no value specified, commands returned from SAML inline hook responses were not applied. (OKTA-263494)

* The [Update User Types API](/docs/reference/api/user-types/#update-user-type) previously allowed the existing name of a User Type to be changed. (OKTA-241788)
