# Okta API Products Release Notes

These release notes list customer-visible changes to API Products by release number. We release first to preview orgs and then production orgs.

Dates for preview release are the earliest possible release date. Always check your org to verify the release for your org.

To verify the current release for an org, check the footer of the administrator UI. If necessary, click the **Admin** button to navigate to your administrator UI.<br>

> **Note:** Changes to Okta unrelated to API Products are published in the [Okta Release Notes](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_relnotes).
