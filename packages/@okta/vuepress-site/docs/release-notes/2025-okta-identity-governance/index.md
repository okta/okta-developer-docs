#### Auditor reporting package is self-service EA

You can now generate access certification campaign reports that are tailored to meet auditor requirements. These reports make preparing for compliance audits faster and easier by reducing the time and manual effort required for assembling and exporting campaign and user access data.

Access certification campaign reports are generated from the auditor reporting package, which is triggered post-campaign completion when the `createReportingPackageEnabled` parameter is true. See [`reportingSettings.createReportingPackageEnabled`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Campaigns/#tag/Campaigns/operation/createCampaign!path=reportingSettings&t=request) in the [Create a campaign](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Campaigns/#tag/Campaigns/operation/createCampaign) resource.
<!--OKTA-982353 IGA_ACCESS_CERT_AUDITOR_REPORTING Preview date: August 13, 2025 -->

#### Entitlement bundle documented response updates

The documented response for [List all entitlement bundles](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlement-Bundles/#tag/Entitlement-Bundles/operation/listEntitlementBundles!c=200&path=data&t=response) and [Retrieve an entitlement bundle](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlement-Bundles/#tag/Entitlement-Bundles/operation/getEntitlementBundle!c=200&path=_links&t=response) has been updated to remove the **One of** (`oneOf`) payload structure. The documented response payload is now flattened to include properties for both `entitlement-bundles-list` and `entitlement-bundles-list-with-entitlements` schemas. This is backward-compatible because the expected returned response schema is the same as before.
<!-- OKTA-985836 Preview date: Sept 10, 2025 -->

#### Resource Owners API is Beta

Drive automation and simplify Okta Identity Governance (OIG) configuration by assigning owners to resources, such as apps, groups, and entitlements. You can automatically assign reviewers for access certifications that are scoped with specific owner-assigned resources. See the [Resource Owners](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Resource-Owners/) API to manage assigning owners to resources in your OIG org.
<!-- OKTA-998871 IGA_RESOURCE_OWNERS Preview date: Sept 10, 2025 -->

#### Governance Labels API is Beta

The Labels API enables you to categorize and organize resources, such as apps, groups, entitlements, and collections. You can create, update, and assign key-value labels to resources to support automation, streamline configuration, and simplify the management of access reviews and requests. See [Labels](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Labels/) API.
<!-- OKTA-998873 IGA_RESOURCE_LABELS Preview date: Sept 10, 2025 -->

#### ORN property included in collections

Collection resources now include their [Okta resource name (ORN)](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#okta-resource-name-orn) in the response payload. See the `orn` property in the [collection resource](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Collections/#tag/Collections/operation/getCollection!c=200&path=orn&t=response).
<!-- OKTA-986274 Preview date: Sept 10, 2025 -->

#### ORN property included in entitlement bundles and values

The entitlement bundle and value resources now include their [Okta resource name (ORN)](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#okta-resource-name-orn) in the response payload. See the `orn` property in the [entitlement value response](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlements/#tag/Entitlements/operation/getEntitlementValue!c=200&path=orn&t=response) and in the [entitlement bundles response](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlement-Bundles/#tag/Entitlement-Bundles/operation/getEntitlementBundle!c=200&path=0/orn&t=response) payloads.
<!-- OKTA-986269 Preview date: Sept 10, 2025 -->

#### Org Governance Settings API is Beta

To complement the [Governance delegates](#governance-delegates-apis-are-beta) feature, admins can now configure whether end users can set their own delegates with the Org Governance Settings API. See [delegates.enduser.permissions](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Org-Governance-Settings/#tag/Org-Governance-Settings/operation/updateOrgSettings!path=delegates/enduser/permissions&t=request) in the [Update the org settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Org-Governance-Settings/#tag/Org-Governance-Settings/operation/updateOrgSettings) API.

End users can also view their delegate permissions in the My Settings API. See [delegates.permissions](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.enduser.v2/tag/My-Settings/#tag/My-Settings/operation/getMySettings!c=200&path=delegates/permissions&t=response) in the [Retrieve the settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.enduser.v2/tag/My-Settings/#tag/My-Settings/operation/getMySettings) API.
<!-- OKTA-982882 OKTA-987070 GOVERNANCE_DELEGATES FF Preview date: Sept 10, 2025 -->

#### Security Access Reviews API is EA

Security Access Reviews are a new, security-focused type of access review that can be automatically triggered by events. These reviews provide a unified view of a user's access and contextual information about their access history. Also included is an AI-generated access summary, allowing you to investigate and take immediate remediation actions like revoking access. See [Security Access Reviews](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-sar) in the product documentation.

See the [Security Access Reviews](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Security-Access-Reviews/) API and [Launch a security access review](/docs/guides/iga-security-access-review/main/) guide for details on how to trigger security access reviews through the API.
<!-- OKTA-1002587 IGA_SECURITY_ACCESS_REVIEW Preview date: Sept 10, 2025 -->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2025.09.0

* Best practice implementations of API use cases are now available for Identity Governance. See **Identity Governance** in the [Guides](/docs/guides/identity-governance/) sidebar.

* Okta Identity Governance campaigns and entitlements can now be managed using the Okta Terraform Provider. This enables customers to manage their governance tasks and configure other resources in their Okta org that are maintained through the Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code tool. For more information, refer to  [Terraform Provider for Okta](https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta) and the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs) documentation.

#### Governance delegates APIs are Beta

<ApiLifecycle access="beta" />

Super admins and users can assign delegates to complete governance tasks. These include access certification campaign reviews and access request approvals, questions, and tasks. When approvers are unavailable, their tasks can be assigned to different stakeholders ( delegates) for a period of time to ensure that governance processes don't stall. This also reduces the time admins and users spend reassigning requests and reviews manually.

The following APIs support the governance delegates flow and are available as Beta:

* Principal Settings API > [Update the principal settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Principal-Settings/#tag/Principal-Settings/operation/updatePrincipalSettings)
* Delegates > [List all delegate appointments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Delegates/#tag/Delegates/operation/listDelegateAppointments)
* My Settings > [Retrieve the settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.enduser.v2/tag/My-Settings/#tag/My-Settings/operation/getMySettings)
* My Settings > [Update the settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.enduser.v2/tag/My-Settings/#tag/My-Settings/operation/updateMySettings)
* My Settings > [List the eligible delegate users](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.enduser.v2/tag/My-Settings/#tag/My-Settings/operation/listMyDelegateUsers)
<!-- OKTA-987070 GOVERNANCE_DELEGATES FF -->

#### List all access request catalog entries for a user is GA

The [List all access request catalog entries for a user](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Catalogs/#tag/Catalogs/operation/listAllDefaultUserEntriesV2) (`GET /governance/api/v2/catalogs/default/user/{userId}/entries`) operation is now included in the **Access Requests - V2** > [Catalogs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Catalogs/) API. As an admin, use this operation to list access request catalog entries for a user. A filter expression query parameter is required to specify the set of entries in the response.
<!-- [OKTA-954146] [OKTA-915784] [OKTA-975991], used for (but not dependent on) ACCESS_REQUESTS_UNIFIED_CATALOG -->

#### Unified requester experience is EA

Use this feature to create a consistent and unified experience for initiating requests in End-User Dashboard, Slack, and Microsoft Teams regardless of whether the request is managed by conditions or request types. This gives you the flexibility to use either or both methods together to manage resource access without altering the requester experience.

* Request types now appear as tiles in the End-User Dashboard's resource catalog alongside other resources. Your settings for a request type's audience continue to govern which users can view the request type on their dashboard and request access.
* In Slack and Microsoft Teams, users can now request access to resources that are governed by access request conditions, and the user experience for requesting resources that are managed by request types has also been changed.

Additionally, in the Okta Access Requests app, the **Access requests** page has been renamed to **Resource catalog** and clicking it redirects requesters to the resource catalog on the End-User Dashboard. The **Request types** section in the web app is only visible to admins and team members who own the request type. See [Create requests](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-ar-create-manage-reqs).

This is an Early Access feature. See [Enable self-service features](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea).

The following Access Request API updates have been made to support the unified requester experience:

* New `REQUEST_TYPE` option for [accessScopeType](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Requests/#tag/Requests/operation/listAllRequestsV2!c=200&path=data/requested/accessScopeType&t=response) in the [Requests](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Requests/) API
* New [validRequestOnBehalfOfSettings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings/operation/getRequestSettingsV2!c=200&path=validRequestOnBehalfOfSettings&t=response) property for [Request Settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/) API
* [Related entry link updates for catalog entry responses](#related-entity-link-updates-for-catalog-entry-responses)
* [List all access request catalog entries for a user](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Catalogs/#tag/Catalogs/operation/listAllDefaultUserEntriesV2) <!-- OKTA-968620 ACCESS_REQUESTS_UNIFIED_CATALOG EA Preview and Prod -->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2025.08.0

The **Archived Okta Identity Governance API changelog (2023-2024)** has been removed.

#### Bug fixed in 2025.08.0

The filtered entitlement bundles request (`GET /governance/api/v1/entitlement-bundles`) with the contains (`co`) operator didn't sort results by the substring's location within the `name` field.

### Monthly release 2025.07.0

| Change | Expected in Preview Orgs |
|--------|--------------------------|
| [Changes to Okta app API responses](#changes-to-okta-app-api-responses) | July 7, 2025 |

#### Changes to Okta app API responses

The following Okta apps won't be returned in the API response for endpoints that list apps (such as the [List all applications](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Application/#tag/Application/operation/listApplications) `GET /api/vi/apps` endpoint):

* Okta Access Certifications (key name: `okta_iga`)
* Okta Access Requests Admin (key name: `okta_access_requests_admin`)
* Okta Entitlement Management (key name: `okta_entitlement_management`)

In addition, a single app retrieval endpoint won't return these apps either. For example: `GET /api/v1/apps/{appId}` won't return the app object if `{appId}` is the ID for the `okta_iga`, `okta_access_requests_admin`, or `okta_entitlement_management` apps in your org.

Breaking change: The [List all entitlement](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlements/#tag/Entitlements/operation/listEntitlements) response no longer returns a `values` object. Previously, this response returned an empty array for this property after the following update in `2024.04.0`: List all entitlements will no longer return values. To fetch values for a given entitlement, use [List all values for an entitlement](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlements/#tag/Entitlements/operation/listEntitlementValues) or [List all entitlement values](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlements/#tag/Entitlements/operation/listAllEntitlementValues). <!-- OKTA-828247 -->

#### New system log event

An `access.request.settings.update` System Log event now appears when a **Request of behalf of** setting is toggled on or off in the Admin Console, or when you set or change the `requestOnBehalfOfSettings` object for [Requests Settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings). The event's `debugData` property includes the app for which the setting was updated and the `changeDetails` property includes the previous and new state of the setting. <!--OKTA-857992-->
