### User Types Error Message Change

Error messages returned by the [User Types API](/docs/reference/api/user-types/) have changed. Omitting display name or variable name when attempting to create a User Type, or specifying a variable name that is already in use, results in a more specific error message being returned. <!-- OKTA-241017 -->

### Bugs Fixed in 2019.10.2

* A `SameSite=None` attribute sent by Okta caused a bug in cross-site handling of cookies in Chrome on iOS 12.* or earlier. (OKTA-254174)
* In the [Features API](/docs/reference/api/features/), when using `mode=force` to enable a feature and its dependencies, email notifications were not sent to admins for Beta dependencies that were enabled. (OKTA-249644)
* The length of EL expressions that you could specify for [OAuth 2.0 claim values](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/#claim-operations) was previously limited to a shorter length but has now been increased to 1024 characters. (OKTA-237675)
