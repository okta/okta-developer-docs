#### Applications API support for SAML metadata attributes

The Applications API now supports metadata dynamic SAML attributes inherited from the SAML app. The SAML attributes are used to manage configured group attributes.The Admin Console displays the dynamic SAML attributes as **Configure SAML Attributes**, and the API returns these attributes as the `settings.signOn.configuredAttributeStatements` property in the [SAML application object](/docs/reference/api/apps/#add-saml-2-0-authentication-application). <!--OKTA-573057,OKTA-549695-->

#### Custom app login deprecated is GA in Production

The custom app login feature is deprecated. This functionality is unchanged for orgs that actively use custom app login. Orgs that don't use custom app login should continue to use the [Okta-hosted sign-in experience](/docs/guides/redirect-authentication/) or [configure IdP routing rules](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-cfg-routing-rules) that redirect users to the appropriate app to sign in. <!--OKTA-561569-->

#### Full-featured code editor is GA in Production

The full-featured code editor makes editing code for the sign-in page, email templates, and error pages more efficient and less reliant on documentation. Developers can write, test, and publish code faster with syntax highlighting, autocomplete for variables, split versus unified diff views, and **Revert**, **Preview**, and **Publish** buttons. See [Use the code editor](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#use-the-code-editor). <!--OKTA-568606-->

#### Log Streaming is GA in Preview

Many organizations use third-party systems to monitor, aggregate, and act on the event data in Okta System Log events.

Log Streaming enables Okta admins to more easily and securely send System Log events to a specified systems, such as the Splunk Cloud or Amazon Eventbridge, in near real time with simple, pre-built connectors. Log streaming scales well even with high event volume, and unlike many existing System Log event collectors, it doesn't require a third-party system to store an Okta Admin API token. See [Log Streaming API](/docs/reference/api/log-streaming/). <!--OKTA-565478-->

#### Multibrand customizations are EA in Preview

Multibrand customizations allow customers to use one org to manage multiple brands and multiple custom domains. This drastically simplifies multi-tenant architectures where customers create multiple orgs to satisfy branding requirements. Multibrand customizations allow orgs to create up to three custom domains (more upon request), which can be mapped to multiple sign-in pages, multiple sets of emails, error pages, and multiple versions of the End-User Dashboard. See [Brands](/docs/concepts/brands/). <!--OKTA-568831, OKTA-568807-->

#### OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/). <!--OKTA-572343 -->

#### OIDC Identity Providers private/public key pair support is GA in Preview

Previously, Okta only supported the use of client secret as the client authentication method with an OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider. Okta now supports the use of private/public key pairs (`private_key_jwt`) with OpenID Connect-based Identity Providers. Additionally, the Signed Request Object now also supports the use of private/public key pairs. See [Create an Identity Provider in Okta](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!--OKTA-573913-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is GA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/). <!--OKTA-571987-->

#### Splunk edition support for Log Streaming integrations is GA in Preview

The Spunk Cloud Log Streaming integration now supports GCP and GovCloud customers. You can set the Splunk edition parameter (`settings.edition`) to AWS (`aws`), GCP (`gcp`), or AWS GovCloud (`aws_govcloud`) in your Log Streaming integration. See [Splunk Cloud Settings properties](/docs/reference/api/log-streaming/#splunk-cloud-settings-properties). <!--OKTA-544449-->

#### Updated AWS EventBridge supported regions for Log Stream integrations

The list of supported AWS EventBridge regions has been updated based on configurable event sources. See the [list of available AWS regions for Log Stream integrations](/docs/reference/api/log-streaming/#property-details-2). <!--OKTA-573094-->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2023.02.0

* A new authorization guide is available to help admins and devs retain the user context in requests to downstream services. This document  provides guidance on how a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/).

* A new requirements guide is available for integration submissions to the Okta Integration Network (OIN). This document provides guidance for the artifacts required during the submission process, such as the logo, the customer configuration document, and the test account. See [OIN submission requirements](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/).

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.02.0

* The `max_age` and `login_hint` parameters in an authorize request were sometimes ignored when a client used the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method. (OKTA-573320)

* GET requests to the `/brands/{brandId}` endpoint didn't return the previously saved `agreeToCustomPrivacyPolicy`. (OKTA-568074)

* GET requests to the `/brands/{brandId}/pages/sign-in/customized` endpoint returned `null` for `widgetCustomizations`. As a result, the updates weren't applied to the Okta Admin Console sign-in page. (OKTA-563838)

* The Add Group API (`/api/v1/groups`) created multiple groups of the same name if called within a short period of time (milliseconds). (OKTA-561481)

* The response took longer than necessary when an admin sent a request to delete an OpenID Connect app. (OKTA-531089)

* The Roles API (`/iam/roles`) didn't support the self and next link relation types. (OKTA-512280)

#### Clock skew for access and ID tokens

A 30-second clock skew is now allowed for access and ID tokens to validate that a token was created before the current time. <!--OKTA-538956 -->

#### Content Security Policy update

Over the next few months, we are gradually releasing enhancements to our [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers. During this time you may notice an increase in header sizes. <!--OKTA-567669-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.2

* Requests made with an empty Origin header returned an error response. (OKTA-449621)

* An error occurred if a request was made to the `/authorize` endpoint of a custom authorization server and the `prompt` parameter value was set to `enroll_authenticator`.  (OKTA-552063)

* Requests to assign a custom role to a user or group returned a generic Bad Request error when the required `role` or `resource-set` property was missing. (OKTA-538237)

* Some custom admins didn't see groups and users that they had access to when they made a `GET` request to the Users (`/users/{id}/groups`) and Groups (`/groups/{id}/users`) APIs. (OKTA-568838)

* An unclear error message was returned when a group rules API call (`create`, `update`, or `activate`) was made to assign users to read-only groups (for example, `Everyone`). (OKTA-567972)

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.1

* Requests failed when an admin used a group limit in an expression that was more than 100 (for example, `getFilteredGroups(groupallowlist, group_expression, 101)`). (OKTA-565041)

* Requests failed when an admin used a group limit in an expression that was less than the number of groups that satisfied the request (for example, `Groups.startsWith("active_directory","eai_",10)`). (OKTA-556056)

* Users could request that one-time passwords for SMS, Voice, and Email activation be resent more times than allowed by the rate limit. (OKTA-550739)

#### Full regional support for AWS EventBridge Log Stream integrations is EA in Preview

The Log Streaming API has expanded support for all commercial regions in the AWS EventBridge Log Stream integration. See [AWS EventBridge Setting property details](/docs/reference/api/log-streaming/#property-details-2). <!-- OKTA-540378-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/). <!-- OKTA-563884-->

#### Password history policy enforced in strict mode is GA in Production

When an admin [updates passwords](/docs/reference/api/users/#update-user) and sets the `strict` parameter to `true`, the [password history policy](/docs/reference/api/policy/#age-object) is now enforced.<!-- OKTA-563910-->

#### PBKDF2 Hashing Algorithm support is GA in Production

Okta now supports Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) for hashing imported user passwords. This hashing algorithm is used to reduce vulnerabilities to brute-force attacks. <!-- OKTA-563886-->

#### Revoke user sessions is GA in Production

You can end all Okta sessions for a user when resetting their password. All sessions of the specified user are revoked except for the current session. This option protects the user account from unauthorized access. See the `revokeSessions` parameter in the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/#change-password). <!-- OKTA-542646-->

#### Unusual telephony requests blocked by machine-learning measures

Okta uses an internal machine-learning-based toll fraud and abuse-detection model to block unusual SMS or voice requests. Telephony requests that are blocked by the model have a `DENY` status in the System Log. <!-- OKTA-562110-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.0

* During the authenticator enrollment flow using the `/authorize` endpoint, users couldn't enroll in the Custom APP authenticator. (OKTA-558352)
