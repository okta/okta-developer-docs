#### OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is GA in Production

OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/). <!--OKTA-572343--> <!--FF: ON_BEHALF_TOKEN_EXCHANGE-->

#### Multibrand customizations are GA in Preview

Multibrand customizations allow customers to use one org to manage multiple brands and multiple custom domains. This drastically simplifies multi-tenant architectures where customers create multiple orgs to satisfy branding requirements. Multibrand customizations allow orgs to create up to three custom domains (more upon request), which can be mapped to multiple sign-in pages, multiple sets of emails, error pages, and multiple versions of the End-User Dashboard. See [Brands](/docs/concepts/brands/). <!--OKTA-587566, OKTA-568807-->

#### Password hooks global availability is GA in Preview

The [Create User with password import inline hook](/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook) operation is now available for all users. Previously, password hooks required a user to be in the `STAGED` status. This change helps better support migration efforts from DelAuth to Okta. <!--OKTA-604521--> <!--FF: ENG_ALLOW_PASSWORD_IMPORT_HOOKS_FOR_USERS_IN_ANY_STATUS--> <!--Originally available in December 2020-->

#### Event hook filtering is EA in Preview

You can now filter individual events of the same event type based on custom business logic hosted in Okta. These filters reduce the amount of events that trigger hooks, removing an unnecessary load on your external service.

This feature includes an improved creation workflow for event hooks and a new **Filters** tab that you can use to create event filters with direct Expression Language statements or with a simple UI format.

Using event hook filters significantly reduces the amount of event hook requests and the need for custom code on your respective services. See [Which events are eligible](/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#which-events-are-eligible) and [Event hook filtering](/docs/guides/event-hook-filtering/main/). <!--OKTA-592286--> <!--FF: EVENT_HOOK_FILTERING-->

#### Identity store property for the Applications API

A new `identityStoreId` property is now available in the Applications API resource (`/api/v1/apps`) to store an identity store app associated with your app. You can set the `identityStoreId` value to the `id` of the identity store app you previously created in the same org. See the [optional `settings.identityStoreId` property](/docs/reference/api/apps/#identity-store-id). <!--OKTA-595777--> <!--FF: DYNAMIC_UI_APPS_API_AUGMENT--> <!--Orig avail 2023.04.2-->

#### Unique refresh token ID added to token inline hook requests

A unique refresh token ID is now included in token inline hook requests. This ensures that the refresh token ID is persisted in the request to maintain seamless access and improve security. <!--OKTA-576905--> <!--FF: ENG_REFRESH_TOKEN_ID_IN_TOKEN_INLINE_HOOK-->

#### Additional measures to counter toll fraud

For SMS and voice authentications, additional mitigation measures now help counter phone number-based toll fraud. <!--OKTA-603999--> <!--Set TEL_CAT_AREA_CODE_RL_RULE to HARD enforcement-->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.05.0

A new event hook guide is available that demonstrates the self-service EA feature event hook filtering. Filter only those event instances you want to trigger an event hook. See [Event hook filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/event-hook-filtering/main/). <!--OKTA-592286-->

#### Bug fixed in 2023.05.0

Admins saw Okta FastPass listed in the `GET /api/v1/users/{{userId}}/factors` response for users who didn't enable the factor. (OKTA-603999)

| [Bug fixed in 2023.04.0](#bug-fixed-in-2023-04-0) | April 05, 2023 |

#### Support added for DPoP with service apps

Okta now supports [Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession](/docs/guides/dpop/main/) for service apps. However, service apps can provide the same level of security by using `private_key_jwt` for [client authentication](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/client-auth/).<!--OKTA-592258-->

#### OAuth 2.0 authentication for inline hooks is GA in Production

Okta inline hook calls to third-party external web services previously provided only header-based authentication for security. Although sent with SSL, the header or custom header authentication didn’t meet more stringent security requirements for various clients and industries.

To improve the security of inline hooks, Okta now supports authentication with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Tokens ensure secure calls to external web services.

When creating inline hooks in the Admin Console (or by API), administrators or developers can now select OAuth 2.0 authentication and choose between two methods of OAuth 2.0: Client Secret or Private Key. A new Key Management API and Admin Console page is also available to create public/private key pairs for use with OAuth 2.0 inline hooks. See [Key management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-key-management).

Using the OAuth 2.0 framework provides better security than Basic Authentication or custom headers, and is less work than setting up an IP allowlisting solution. Clients also have the ability to use access tokens minted by their own custom authorization servers to guarantee that Okta is calling their client web services and isn't triggered by any external actors. See [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook). <!--OKTA-581803-->

#### API service integrations are GA in Production

A service-to-service app where a backend service or a daemon calls Okta management APIs for a tenant (Okta org) can be published in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) as an API service integration. This integration type allows your service app to access your customer Okta org through Okta management APIs using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow. API service integrations provide secure, reliable, and least-privilege scoped access to Okta APIs without being associated with a user, so service isn’t disrupted when the user is no longer involved with service integration activities. See [API service integrations in the OIN](/docs/guides/oin-api-service-overview/). OIN Manager has been updated to support testing and submitting API service integrations. After your service integration is published in the OIN, workforce customers can discover and configure your integration with ease. See [Build an API service integration](/docs/guides/build-api-integration/main/). <!--OKTA-577514-->

#### OIN Manager support for Workflow Connector submission is GA in Production

Okta [Workflows](https://www.okta.com/platform/workflows/) is a no-code, if-this-then-that logic builder that Okta orgs can use to automate custom or complex employee onboarding and offboarding flows in your application. You can now publish Workflow connectors that you create with the [Workflows Connector Builder](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=wf&id=ext-connector-builder) in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) catalog. Publishing a Workflows connector with Okta allows your customers to deeply integrate your product with all other connectors in the catalog. Submit your Workflow connector by using the OIN Manager. See [Submit an integration](/docs/guides/submit-app/wfconnector/main/#submit-an-integration) for Workflows connectors. <!--OKTA-571943 & OKTA-573202-->

#### OAuth 2.0 grant scopes added

The OAuth 2.0 `okta.appGrants.manage` and `okta.appGrants.read` grant scopes are now available for use with the `/apps/{id}/grants` and `/apps/{id}/grants/{grantId}` endpoints.<!--OKTA-568970-->

#### Scope parameter length increased

The maximum length for the scope parameter of a refresh token request is now 4096 characters.<!--OKTA-573127-->

#### OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is GA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/). <!--OKTA-572343 -->

#### Configurable rate limits for OAuth 2.0 apps is GA in Production

Rate limit violations mainly occur on authenticated endpoints. Currently, it isn't clear which OAuth 2.0 authenticated app consumes all the rate limits for an org. This increases the risk that one app consumes the entire rate limit bucket. To avoid this possibility, Okta admins can now configure how much rate limit capacity an individual OAuth 2.0 app can consume by editing the Application rate limits tab for each app. By setting a capacity on individual OAuth 2.0 apps, Okta admins have a new tool to monitor and investigate rate limit violations, and have the ability to view rate limit traffic generated by individual OAuth 2.0 apps. See [Rate limit dashboard bar graph](/docs/reference/rl-dashboard/#bar-graph). <!--OKTA-573387-->

#### Developer documentation update in 2023.04.0

A new sign-in redirect guide is available for single page apps (SPA) using JavaScript and the Auth JS SDK. No frontend framework required! A quick and easy demonstration of the redirect sign-in flow. See [Sign users in to your SPA using the redirect model and Auth JS](/docs/guides/auth-js-redirect/main/). <!--OKTA-577531-->

#### Bug fixed in 2023.04.0

The Identity Sources API bulk upsert operation accepted an empty profile payload. (OKTA-533011)

#### Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession is self-service EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to OAuth 2.0 access tokens. It enables the client to demonstrate that it possesses a particular key or secret associated with the access token. OAuth 2.0 DPoP can help prevent certain attacks, such as token theft or token replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts a legitimate access token and uses it to gain unauthorized access to a protected resource. See [Configure OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession](/docs/guides/dpop/main/). <!--OKTA-585491-->

#### Bug fixed in 2023.03.1

Using the Policy API, admins were able to set the `MFA_ENROLL` policy factor settings to allow Okta Verify Push but not allow Okta Verify OTP at the same time. (OKTA-567906)

See [Rate limit dashboard bar graph](/docs/reference/rl-dashboard/#bar-graph). <!--OKTA-573387-->

#### OIDC Identity Providers private/public key pair support is GA

Previously, Okta only supported the use of client secret as the client authentication method with an OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider. Okta now supports the use of private/public key pairs (`private_key_jwt`) with OpenID Connect-based Identity Providers. Additionally, the Signed Request Object now also supports the use of private/public key pairs. See [Create an Identity Provider in Okta](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#custom-okta-hosted-sign-in-page). <!--OKTA-573913-->

#### API service integrations are GA in Preview

A service-to-service app where a backend service or a daemon calls Okta management APIs for a tenant (Okta org) can be published in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) as an API service integration.

See [API service integrations in the OIN](/docs/guides/oin-api-service-overview/). OIN Manager has been updated to support testing and submitting API service integrations. After your service integration is published in the OIN, workforce customers can discover and configure your integration with ease. See [Build an API service integration](/docs/guides/build-api-integration/main/). <!--OKTA-577514-->

#### Log Streaming is GA in Production

Many organizations use third-party systems to monitor, aggregate, and act on the event data in Okta System Log events.

Log Streaming enables Okta admins to more easily and securely send System Log events to a specified systems, such as the Splunk Cloud or Amazon Eventbridge, in near real time with simple, pre-built connectors. Log streaming scales well even with high event volume, and unlike many existing System Log event collectors, it doesn't require a third-party system to store an Okta Admin API token. See [Log Streaming API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/). <!--OKTA-578532-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is GA in Production

OAuth 2.0 Optional consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/main/). <!--OKTA-581292-->

#### OAuth 2.0 authentication for inline hooks is GA in Preview

Okta inline hook calls to third-party external web services previously provided only header-based authentication for security. Although sent with SSL, the header or custom header authentication didn’t meet more stringent security requirements for various clients and industries.

See [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook). <!--OKTA-581803-->

#### Honor force authentication support for SAML Apps API

Previously, the **Honor Force Authentication** parameter (`honorForceAuthn`) could only be set from the [SAML 2.0 App Integration Wizard](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-apps-aiw-saml). When this property is set to `true`, users are prompted for their credentials when a SAML request has the `ForceAuthn` attribute set to `true`. You can now set this property for your SAML app without using the app integration wizard. See the [SAML 2.0 settings parameters in the Apps API](/docs/reference/api/apps/#add-saml-2-0-authentication-application). <!--OKTA-550077-->

#### OIN Manager support for Workflow Connector submission is GA in Preview

Okta [Workflows](https://www.okta.com/platform/workflows/) is a no-code, if-this-then-that logic builder that Okta orgs can use to automate custom or complex employee onboarding and offboarding flows in your application. You can now publish Workflow connectors that you create with the [Workflows Connector Builder](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=wf&id=ext-connector-builder) in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) catalog.

See [Submit an integration](/docs/guides/submit-app/wfconnector/main/#submit-an-integration) for Workflows connectors. <!--OKTA-571943 & OKTA-573202-->

#### Rate limit increased for Event Hooks

The number of events that can be delivered to Event Hooks is now 400,000 events per org, per day. See [Rate limits](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#rate-limits). <!--OKTA-573847-->

#### Bug fixed in 2023.03.0

When an admin used a group limit in an expression that was greater than 100 (for example, `Groups.startsWith("active_directory","",500)` ), /userinfo endpoint requests failed. (OKTA-576414)

#### Applications API support for SAML metadata attributes

The Applications API now supports metadata dynamic SAML attributes inherited from the SAML app. The SAML attributes are used to manage configured group attributes. The Admin Console displays the dynamic SAML attributes as **Configure SAML Attributes**, and the API returns these attributes as the `settings.signOn.configuredAttributeStatements` property in the [SAML application object](/docs/reference/api/apps/#add-saml-2-0-authentication-application). <!--OKTA-573057,OKTA-549695-->

#### Custom app login deprecated is GA in Production

The custom app login feature is deprecated. This functionality is unchanged for orgs that actively use custom app login. Orgs that don't use custom app login should continue to use the [Okta-hosted sign-in experience](/docs/guides/redirect-authentication/) or [configure IdP routing rules](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-cfg-routing-rules) that redirect users to the appropriate app to sign in. <!--OKTA-561569-->

#### Full-featured code editor is GA in Production

The full-featured code editor makes editing code for the sign-in page, email templates, and error pages more efficient and less reliant on documentation. Developers can write, test, and publish code faster with syntax highlighting, autocomplete for variables, split versus unified diff views, and **Revert**, **Preview**, and **Publish** buttons. See [Use the code editor](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#use-the-code-editor). <!--OKTA-568606-->

#### Log Streaming is GA in Preview

Many organizations use third-party systems to monitor, aggregate, and act on the event data in Okta System Log events.

Log Streaming enables Okta admins to more easily and securely send System Log events to a specified systems, such as the Splunk Cloud or Amazon Eventbridge, in near real time with simple, pre-built connectors. Log streaming scales well even with high event volume, and unlike many existing System Log event collectors, it doesn't require a third-party system to store an Okta Admin API token. See [Log Streaming API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/). <!--OKTA-565478-->

#### Multibrand customizations are EA in Preview

Multibrand customizations allow customers to use one org to manage multiple brands and multiple custom domains. This drastically simplifies multi-tenant architectures where customers create multiple orgs to satisfy branding requirements. Multibrand customizations allow orgs to create up to three custom domains (more upon request), which can be mapped to multiple sign-in pages, multiple sets of emails, error pages, and multiple versions of the End-User Dashboard. See [Brands](/docs/concepts/brands/). <!--OKTA-568831, OKTA-568807-->

#### OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/). <!--OKTA-572343 -->

#### OIDC Identity Providers private/public key pair support is GA in Preview

Previously, Okta only supported the use of client secret as the client authentication method with an OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider. Okta now supports the use of private/public key pairs (`private_key_jwt`) with OpenID Connect-based Identity Providers. Additionally, the Signed Request Object now also supports the use of private/public key pairs. See [Create an Identity Provider in Okta](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). <!--OKTA-573913-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is GA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/). <!--OKTA-571987-->

#### Splunk edition support for Log Streaming integrations is GA in Preview

The Spunk Cloud Log Streaming integration now supports GCP and GovCloud customers. You can set the Splunk edition parameter (`settings.edition`) to AWS (`aws`), GCP (`gcp`), or AWS GovCloud (`aws_govcloud`) in your Log Streaming integration. See [Splunk Cloud Settings properties](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/#tag/LogStream/operation/createLogStream!path=1/settings&t=request). <!--OKTA-544449-->

#### Updated AWS EventBridge supported regions for Log Stream integrations

The list of supported AWS EventBridge regions has been updated based on configurable event sources. See the [list of available AWS regions for Log Stream integrations](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/#tag/LogStream/operation/createLogStream!path=0/settings/region&t=request). <!--OKTA-573094-->

#### Developer documentation updates in 2023.02.0

* The Okta Developer portal has a new look and feel. The [home page](https://developer.okta.com/) features a curated set of resources on developer use cases for Workforce Identity Cloud solutions. You can also access the featured blog posts to stay up to date with implementing Okta features.

* A new authorization guide is available to help admins and devs retain the user context in requests to downstream services. This document  provides guidance on how a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client with a new token by interacting with the authorization server. See [Set up OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](/docs/guides/set-up-token-exchange/main/).

* A new requirements guide is available for integration submissions to the Okta Integration Network (OIN). This document provides guidance for the artifacts required during the submission process, such as the logo, the customer configuration document, and the test account. See [OIN submission requirements](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/).

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.02.0

* The `max_age` and `login_hint` parameters in an authorize request were sometimes ignored when a client used the `private_key_jwt` client authentication method. (OKTA-573320)

* GET requests to the `/brands/{brandId}` endpoint didn't return the previously saved `agreeToCustomPrivacyPolicy`. (OKTA-568074)

* GET requests to the `/brands/{brandId}/pages/sign-in/customized` endpoint returned `null` for `widgetCustomizations`. As a result, the updates weren't applied to the Okta Admin Console sign-in page. (OKTA-563838)

* The Add Group API (`/api/v1/groups`) created multiple groups of the same name if called within a short period of time (milliseconds). (OKTA-561481)

* The response took longer than necessary when an admin sent a request to delete an OpenID Connect app. (OKTA-531089)

* The Roles API (`/iam/roles`) didn't support the self and next link relation types. (OKTA-512280)

#### Content Security Policy update

Over the next few months, we are gradually releasing enhancements to our [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers. During this time you may notice an increase in header sizes. <!--OKTA-567669-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.2

* Requests made with an empty Origin header returned an error response. (OKTA-449621)

* An error occurred if a request was made to the `/authorize` endpoint of a custom authorization server and the `prompt` parameter value was set to `enroll_authenticator`.  (OKTA-552063)

* Requests to assign a custom role to a user or group returned a generic Bad Request error when the required `role` or `resource-set` property was missing. (OKTA-538237)

* Some custom admins didn't see groups and users that they had access to when they made a `GET` request to the Users (`/users/{id}/groups`) and Groups (`/groups/{id}/users`) APIs. (OKTA-568838)

* An unclear error message was returned when a group rules API call (`create`, `update`, or `activate`) was made to assign users to read-only groups (for example, `Everyone`). (OKTA-567972)

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.1

* Requests failed when an admin used a group limit in an expression that was more than 100 (for example, `getFilteredGroups(groupallowlist, group_expression, 101)`). (OKTA-565041)

* Requests failed when an admin used a group limit in an expression that was less than the number of groups that satisfied the request (for example, `Groups.startsWith("active_directory","eai_",10)`). (OKTA-556056)

* Users could request that one-time passwords for SMS, Voice, and Email activation be resent more times than allowed by the rate limit. (OKTA-550739)

#### Full regional support for AWS EventBridge Log Stream integrations is EA in Preview

The Log Streaming API has expanded support for all commercial regions in the AWS EventBridge Log Stream integration. See [AWS EventBridge Setting property details](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/#tag/LogStream/operation/createLogStream!path=0/settings/region&t=request). <!-- OKTA-540378-->

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See [Request user consent](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/). <!-- OKTA-563884-->

#### Password history policy enforced in strict mode is GA in Production

When an admin [updates passwords](/docs/reference/api/users/#update-user) and sets the `strict` parameter to `true`, the [password history policy](/docs/reference/api/policy/#age-object) is now enforced.<!-- OKTA-563910-->

#### PBKDF2 Hashing Algorithm support is GA in Production

Okta now supports Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) for hashing imported user passwords. This hashing algorithm is used to reduce vulnerabilities to brute-force attacks. <!-- OKTA-563886-->

#### Revoke user sessions is GA in Production

You can end all Okta sessions for a user when resetting their password. All sessions of the specified user are revoked except for the current session. This option protects the user account from unauthorized access. See the `revokeSessions` parameter in the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/#change-password). <!-- OKTA-542646-->

#### Unusual telephony requests blocked by machine-learning measures

Okta uses an internal machine-learning-based toll fraud and abuse-detection model to block unusual SMS or voice requests. Telephony requests that are blocked by the model have a `DENY` status in the System Log. <!-- OKTA-562110-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.0

* During the authenticator enrollment flow using the `/authorize` endpoint, users couldn't enroll in the Custom App authenticator. (OKTA-558352)

* The Log Streaming API returned the Splunk Cloud `token` property in the response body. (OKTA-437264)
