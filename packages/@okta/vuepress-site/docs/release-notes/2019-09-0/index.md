### Features API is Early Access (EA) in Preview and Production

The [Features API](/docs/reference/api/features/) provides operations to manage self-service features in your Production and Preview orgs and Beta features in your Preview org. <!-- OKTA-241445 -->

### Mappings API is now Generally Available (GA) in Production

The Okta Mappings API provides operations to manage the mapping of properties between an Okta User's and an App User's
[Profile Properties](/docs/reference/api/users/#profile-object) using [Expression Language](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language). This feature is now GA in Production. <!-- OKTA-241945 -->

### Error Object in SAML Assertion Inline Hook

For the SAML Assertion Inline Hook, if an external service returns an `error` object, Okta now denies the SAML request and redirects the end user to an error page that displays the text string sent in `error.errorSummary`. <!-- OKTA-195167 -->

### Rate Limits for /oauth2 Endpoints

Rate limiting has been modified for `/oauth2` endpoints so that requests that use an invalid client ID do not consume rate limit. Additionally, a System Log warning has been introduced to provide notification of high rate limit consumption by requests that use a valid client ID. <!-- OKTA-241945 -->

### Rate Limits for Authorization Server Public Metadata

The public metadata endpoints for Authorization Servers are now each assigned separate rate limits, which are not shared with other endpoints. <!-- OKTA-226100 -->

### Bugs Fixed in 2019.09.0

* Responses from the [`GET /groups/rules`](/docs/reference/api/groups/#get-group-rule) API included deleted groups in the `assignUserToGroups.groupIds` property. (OKTA-242994)

* Calls to the [`/users/${userid}/lifecycle/deactivate`](/docs/reference/api/users/#deactivate-user) endpoint could time out when deactivating a user with an extraordinarily high number of app assignments.
