### Token Inline Hook Can Modify or Remove Existing Claims (Early Access)

The [Token Inline Hook](/use_cases/inline_hooks/token_hook/token_hook/) now supports changing or removing existing claims in tokens minted by the Okta Custom Authorization Server. <!-- (OKTA-218305) -->

### Bugs Fixed in 2019.05.3

* Responses from the `GET /groups/rules` [API](/docs/api/resources/groups/#list-group-rules) failed to include a link to the next page of results in cases where there was more than one page. (OKTA-221434)

* Calls to the `/authorize` endpoint during the Authorization Code with PKCE flow would fail if an `idp` parameter was supplied with the call (in Preview orgs only). (OKTA-229808)
