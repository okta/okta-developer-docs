### Authentication Object for Step-up Authentication Is in Early Access

During [SP-initiated](/docs/api/resources/authn/#sp-initiated-step-up-authentication) or [IdP-initiated](/docs/api/resources/authn/#idp-initiated-step-up-authentication) authentication, use the [Authentication Object](/docs/api/resources/authn/#authentication-object) to represent details that the target resource is using.

The Authentication Object is an [Early Access feature](/docs/api/getting_started/releases-at-okta).

### New Version of the Okta Sign-In Widget

[Version 2.8.0 of the Okta Sign-In Widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-signin-widget) provides new features, notable changes, and bug fixes. For details, visit the [okta-signin-widget repository](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/releases/tag/okta-signin-widget-2.8.0).


### Bug Fixed in 2018.18

If the configured default IdP was set to inactive, Okta still used the inactive IdP as the primary endpoint for user authentications, causing authentications to fail. (OKTA-137758)
