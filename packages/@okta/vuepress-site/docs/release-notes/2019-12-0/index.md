### Features API is Generally Available in Production

The [Features API](/docs/reference/api/features/) allows operations to manage self-service Early Access features in Production and Preview orgs, as well as manage self-service Beta features in Preview orgs and view Beta features in Production orgs. <!-- OKTA-259575 --> 

### Token Inline Hook is Generally Available in Production

The [Token Inline Hook](/docs/reference/token-hook/) enables you to integrate your own custom functionality into the process of minting OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect tokens. <!-- OKTA-244859 -->

### SAML Inline Hook is Generally Available in Production 

The [SAML Inline Hook](/docs/reference/saml-hook/) enables you to customize SAML assertions returned by Okta. You can add attributes or modify existing attributes in outbound SAML assertions. <!-- OKTA-244860 -->

### Scope Object Properties Default Values 

In Scope objects created using the [Authorization Server API](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/), the default values of the `displayName` and `description` properties were updated to be more informative. <!-- OKTA-242646 -->

### Okta-Hosted User Consent Dialog Change

In OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect [authentication flows](/docs/guides/request-user-consent/overview/), Okta-hosted user consent dialogs were updated to display neutral colors for some UI elements. <!-- OKTA-262803 -->

### OAuth for Okta Enabled for Clear User Sessions Endpoint

The [Clear User Sessions endpoint](/docs/reference/api/users/#clear-user-sessions) now has OAuth for Okta enabled.

### Bug Fixed in 2019.12.0

* In the [Authorization Server API](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/), supplying a `consent` property was previously required when creating a Scope object in orgs that had the EA feature enabled. It is now required only when updating existing Scope objects. (OKTA-250368)
