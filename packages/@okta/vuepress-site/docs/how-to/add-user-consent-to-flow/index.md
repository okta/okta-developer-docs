# Add Okta's User Consent Dialog to Your Authentication Flow

<ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

## User Consent in Okta

If you want users to acknowledge and accept that they are giving an app access to their data, you can configure an Okta-hosted user consent dialog for OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect authentication flows. With the correct configuration, Okta displays a consent dialog showing which app is asking for access. The dialog displays the app logo you specify, and also provides details about what data will be shared if the user consents.

You can optionally configure the consent dialog to link to your terms of service or privacy policy documents.

## User Consent and Tokens

User consent represents a user's explicit permission to allow an application to access resources protected by scopes. Consent grants are different from tokens because a consent can outlast a token, and there can be multiple tokens with varying sets of scopes derived from a single consent.

When an application needs to get a new access token from an authorization server, it may not need to prompt the user for consent if they have already consented to the specified scopes. Consent grants remain valid until the user or admin manually revokes them, or until the user, application, authorization server or scope is deactivated or deleted.

## How to Require User Consent

Use the following procedure to display the user consent dialog as part of an OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 request:

1. Verify that you have the API Access Management feature enabled, and that User Consent is also enabled. If both features are enabled, you'll see a **User Consent** panel in the General tab for OpenID Connect apps.

    To enable these features, contact [Support](https://support.okta.com/help/open_case).

2. Add an OpenID Connect app via the Apps API. The value you should specify for `consent_method` depends on the values for `prompt` and `consent`. Check the Apps API [table of values](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/apps/#add-oauth-20-client-application) for these three properties. In most cases, `REQUIRED` is the correct value.

    Optionally, you can set the appropriate values for your Terms of Service (`tos_uri`) and Privacy Policy (`policy_uri`) notices using the same API request.

    Note: You can also create and configure an app in the administrator UI by navigating to **Applications > Add Application**.

3. [Enable consent](/docs/api/resources/authorization-servers#create-a-scope) for the scopes that you want to require consent. To do this, set the `consent` property to `REQUIRED`.

    Note: You can also specify these values when you create and configure a scope in the administrator UI. Navigate to **Applications > [Application Name] > General > User Consent** and select **Require user consent for this scope** (it can be overriden by individual apps).

4. Prepare an authentication or authorization request with the correct values for `prompt` and `consent_method`. For details, see the [API documentation for `prompt`](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#parameter-details) and the [table of values relating to consent dialog](/docs/api/resources/apps/#settings-7).

5. Test your configuration by initiating an authentication or authorization request. For instance, if you set `consent` to `REQUIRED` for the `email` scope, you can open this URL in a browser:

    ```bash
    https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/${authenticationServerId}/v1/authorize?client_id=${clientId}&response_type=token&response_mode=fragment&scope=email&redirect_uri=http://localhost:54321&state=${state}&nonce=${nonce}
    ```

    Opening this URL will show the user consent dialog. Click **Allow** to create the grant.

## Verification

If you want to verify that you've successfully created a user grant, here are a few ways:

* Check the ID token payload if you requested an ID token. The payload should contain the requested scopes.

    ```
    {
      "ver": 1,
      "jti": "AT.HVDRVIwbyq2jmP0SeNjyvMKq5zsMvUNJlzvXH5rfvOA",
      "iss": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default",
      "aud": "Test",
      "iat": 1524520458,
      "exp": 1524524058,
      "cid": "xfnIflwIn2TkbpNBs6JQ",
      "uid": "00u5t60iloOHN9pBi0h7",
      "scp": [
        "email",
      ],
      "sub": "saml.jackson@stark.com"
    }
    ```

* Check the access token if you requested one. The payload should contain:

    ```
    {
      "sub": "00u5t60iloOHN9pBi0h7",
      "email": "saml.jackson@stark.com",
      "ver": 1,
      "iss": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/${authenticationServerId}",
      "aud": "xfnIflwIn2TkbpNBs6JQ",
      "iat": 1524520458,
      "exp": 1524524058,
      "jti": "ID.lcnZvvp-5PQYlTNEfv3Adq6PotmYBcl1D1S-zErEhuk",
      "amr": [
        "pwd"
      ],
      "nonce": "nonce",
      "auth_time": 1000,
      "at_hash": "preview_at_hash"
    }
    ```

* You can verify that a grant was created by listing the grants given by a specific user:

    ```bash
    curl -v -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token} \
    "https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/${userId}/grants"
    ```

    The response should contain the grant you created when you clicked **Allow** in the previous step.

            }
        }
    ]
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the consent prompt when expected:

* Verify that you haven't already provided consent for that combination of app and scope(s). Use the [`/grants` endpoint](/docs/api/resources/users/#list-grants) to see which grants have been given, and to revoke grants.
* Check the settings for `prompt`, `consent`, and `consent_method` in the [Apps API table of values](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/apps/#add-oauth-20-client-application).
* Make sure that in your app configuration, the `redirect_uri` is an absolute URI and that it is whitelisted by specifying in Trusted Origins.
* If you aren't using the `default` authorization server, check that you've created at least one policy with one rule that applies to any scope or the scope(s) in your test.
