# Apply your brand to the Okta user experience

Design and apply a custom look and feel to the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget that matches your brand.

## Introduction

You have a customer-facing app that uses the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget and messaging services. Design and apply your own look and feel to these elements, which keeps your customers engaged. And, when you deliver a seamless, branded experience, you build trust with your users.

## Learn

There are three key elements to the theming of the Okta out-of-the-box user experience:

* The [Sign-In Widget](/docs/concepts/sign-in-widget/) is the default Okta UI for registration, enrollment, verification, and account recovery. You can customize it to match your brand.
* The [Okta Expression Language](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/) is used to customize our email and SMS messages.
* Okta [Brands](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/brands/) allows you to manage multiple brands in one Okta org.

See the [repository of example style sheets for the Sign-In Widget](LINK_HERE) for examples of the types of updates that you can make.

> Note: This document is only for Identity Engine. See [Identify your Okta solution](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-oie-version) to determine your Okta version.

## Plan

To get the most from the Okta branding options:

* Purchase a custom domain for your org to associate with the brand.
* Identify your brand-matching design for the Sign-In Widget.
* Identify how messages and error pages from Okta should be worded to reflect your brand.
* Decide if you want to use [one domain for all brands or separate domains](LINK_HERE).

Users that make branding changes in the Admin Console must have a super admin or org admin role, or have [a role with customization permissions](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-create-role).

## Build

To apply your brand to the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget, consider an upgrade to the third-generation Sign-In Widget, and then register a vanity domain.

### Upgrade the Sign-In Widget

Consider using the third generation Sign-In Widget for the best customization options:

* [Understand the differences between the second and third-generation widget](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/reference/siw-compare-generations.htm?cshid=ext-compare-siw)
* [Learn how to upgrade to the third-generation widget](/docs/guides/custom-widget-migration-gen3/main/)

### Register a vanity domain with your org

All customizations are tied to the custom domain that you must first attach to your org. See [Add a custom domain to your org](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/main/).

### Apply your brand to the Sign-In Widget

Create a stylesheet and any required JavaScript for custom behaviors and attach it to your custom domain in the Admin Console:

* Use [our samples repo](LINK_HERE) to build the correct CSS to match your design.
* Add your style sheets and scripts. You can do this using either the [second](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#style-for-redirect-authentication) or [third-generation](/docs/guides/custom-widget-gen3/main/) widget.
* [Use design tokens](/docs/guides/custom-widget-gen3/main/). You can do this using the third-generation widget.

### Apply your brand to Okta default text elements

Customize the text of emails, SMS messages, and error pages delivered by Okta for a custom domain and also localize it to match your messaging:

* [Customize your email templates](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/)
  * [Add app-level context logic](/docs/guides/custom-email/main/)
* [Customize your SMS messages](/docs/guides/custom-sms-messaging/main/)
* [Customize your error pages](/docs/guides/custom-error-pages/main/)

## Test your customizations

The Okta default UI spans user registration, enrollment, verification, and account recovery:

* Test that your new branding is consistent for your users across all four actions.
* Test that your error pages work as expected.
* Test that your text works in different languages as expected.
* [Copy/Synchronize your settings from UAT to Production (using the Admin Console or Terraform)](LINK_HERE)
