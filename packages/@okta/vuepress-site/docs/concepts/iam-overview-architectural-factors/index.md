# Architectural factors

IAM is critical to how users perceive and interact with their apps. A good IAM experience is seamless, with the least user involvement with IAM that security permits when accessing an app. A poor IAM experience can result in users developing a poor opinion of the app or not using the app at all.

Identity or IAM is a collection of capabilities/building blocks essential for enabling your overall architecture and user experience. Your IAM solution's success depends on meeting some strict architectural requirements.

This guide details specific architectural capabilities for making your solution as robust as possible for your org and as seamless as possible for your users. These capabilities are highly complex to build and integrate on your own if they aren't a core competency. It's more efficient and effective to consider them in your high-level design as early as possible in your solution's life cycle.

Failure to meet any of the capabilities can lead to the following:

- Reduced availability
- Higher support costs
- Business disruptions
- Erosion of trust
- Customer and user dissatisfaction
- Damage to your reputation
- Expensive breaches and lost business, in the worst-case scenario

> **Note:** This list isn't comprehensive. Strategies for breaches are too numerous and complex to go into here. Okta intends to identify some of the critical Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for your IAM solution and to illustrate a few possible strategies to address them.

See [**IAM Terminology**](/docs/concepts/iam-overview-iam-terminology/) for definitions of some terms and concepts used in this article.

## Availability

Design your IAM solution to be highly available. Consider strategies such as these to help meet your availability goals:

- Architect and design your solution with the collective availability requirements of your apps and customers in mind. Your objective is to meet or exceed their combined needs. Consider any new availability requirements likely to emerge with business growth and other changes in the next few years.

- Provide redundancy, backup, monitoring, failure detection and recovery, notifications, and support procedures. This helps you avoid outages and recover quickly from planned or unplanned outages.

- Meet requirements in [Reliability](#reliability) and [Scalability](#scalability), listed in the following sections. Your solution is only available when it's operating correctly and can handle its workload.

- Provide a way to measure your solution's availability, report metrics for analysis, and verify that your solution meets its SLA availability requirements.

## Reliability

Design your IAM solution to be highly reliable with high data integrity. Make sure that every feature works correctly and can properly handle anomalies such as user and system errors. Consider strategies such as these to help achieve high reliability:

- Design and develop aggressive error detection and error handling techniques. Ideally for Architectural Factors, you should validate every piece of incoming data that your solution uses and never assume that any operation has succeeded without checking. Attempt to recover from errors that may be transient and tolerate unrecoverable errors and faults whenever possible.

- Design your solution (as much as possible) to minimize opportunities for human errors and provide a way to quickly and easily recover when they happen.

- Provide facilities to log, track, and report errors, monitor error logs, and report metrics for analysis and handling. Also, verify that your solution meets its SLA reliability requirements.

## Performance

Design your IAM operations to complete quickly and have consistent and predictable response times with minimal overhead. If an operation takes longer than two or three seconds, let the user know it's still active and when it will complete. Consider strategies such as these to help meet your performance goals:

- Architect and design your solution with performance in mind. Develop an early understanding of your performance risks, establish performance targets, and factor performance into the design and implementation. Understand how your solution degrades under load.

- Choose infrastructure technologies, architecture models, identity storage design, and processing frameworks that can meet or exceed your long-term performance requirements.

- Provide a way to monitor your solution's performance, report metrics for analysis, and verify that your solution meets its SLA performance requirements.

## Scalability

Design your IAM solution to smoothly adapt to and handle rapid changes in workload caused by user growth, new use cases, and evolving business requirements. Keep the user experience consistent, seamless, and secure for everyone. Consider strategies such as these to help ensure that your solution scales smoothly without requiring design changes:

- Choose an architecture model that can accommodate your scaling requirements.

- Consider basing your solution on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

- Design your identity storage and infrastructure to scale to meet or exceed your performance goals as requirements change.

- Provide a way to monitor your solution's performance, report metrics for analysis, and verify that your solution meets its SLA performance requirements.

## Security

Your IAM solution is all about security. It's your app's guardian against unauthorized access and the problems that come with it. Design your solution to authenticate every user sign-in and access request reliably. Also, only allow authenticated users to access the services and data for which they have permission. Consider strategies such as these to help ensure that your solution meets your security requirements:

- Don't use root access keys. Use other commonplace security measures to guard against unauthorized and inappropriate access to your apps, resources, and IAM facilities and data.

- Grant users and admins the lowest level of privilege they need to perform their tasks.

- Design and build your solution using Zero Trust principles.

- Require multifactor authentication for all users and configure strong password policies.

- Use customer-managed policies when appropriate, validate your policies, and regularly review and monitor them.

- Define conditions under which your policies allow access to resources.

- Perform thorough penetration testing to help detect exploitable vulnerabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of your security measures.

- Know all of your solution's open source and third-party components and libraries. Ensure that youâ€™re getting announcements about vulnerabilities from your vendors and communities. When they report a vulnerability, know how to resolve it.

- Make your solution highly reliable and employ techniques such as those listed in [Reliability](#reliability).

## Compliance

*Compliance* refers to procedures and facilities for ensuring that an app meets specific regulatory requirements for privacy and industry and local cybersecurity standards. Support for compliance is essential in any app that handles information that can identify an individual, such as healthcare patient records, or financial account data.

Design your IAM solution to meet the applicable compliance requirements of every app it serves. Failure can lead to financial loss, security breaches, license revocations, business disruptions, erosion of trust, damage to your reputation, and lost business.

Consider strategies such as these to help ensure that your solution meets your compliance requirements:

- Understand which compliance regulations apply to the apps served by your IAM solution and how each affects your solution. Then design, build, and test your solution to meet them.

- Understand the privacy and data retention requirements for the compliance policies that you support, and factor them into your architecture and design. Be sure to consider a user's right to be forgotten in any jurisdictions in which it applies.

- Allow admins to specify the compliance types for apps that your solution serves. Also, allow admins to specify a way to view and update those settings by those accounts with permission to do so.

- Keep all compliance-sensitive data, such as user identity information, in separate storage with appropriate access controls to limit access. Encrypt that storage for further security.

- Define special permissions for accessing compliance-sensitive data other than your own. Provide facilities for authorized admins to assign those permissions. Develop procedures for limiting the assignment and use of those permissions.

- Develop procedures or facilities to keep your solution up to date with the compliance requirements of the apps that it serves.

- Develop procedures to keep your solution up to date with any applicable regulatory requirements.

- Log all accesses to compliance-sensitive data and make the logs available for analysis and audits.

- Be prepared to demonstrate how your solution meets applicable regulatory compliance requirements and to work with app developers to help them meet their requirements.

## Maintainability

Ongoing maintenance typically accounts for most software costs. Design your solution to be straightforward to troubleshoot and resolve issues. Accommodate business, app, platform, technology, and security requirements changes. Apply patches to infrastructure software, rigorously test all elements of your solution, and deploy changes. Failure can result in app outages, degraded-mode operations, and higher development. Failure can also result in maintenance, support costs, delayed app releases, erosion of trust, and damage to your reputation.

Consider strategies such as these to help make your solution as maintainable as possible:

- Make your solution highly reliable and employ techniques such as those listed in [Reliability](#reliability).

- Make it easy for your DevOps, admin, and support teams to use your solution's features and keep it running smoothly. Also, make it easy for your engineers to test your solution and deploy updates.

- Assume that many engineers will work on your solution over time. Make it easy for new engineers to understand your solution by avoiding complexity and modularizing your design. Be sure to document its design and implementation.

- Consider evolution in your design and plan for it. Make it easy to resolve issues and for engineers to adapt it to changing requirements, technologies, and security challenges.
