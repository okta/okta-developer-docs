# Multibrand architecture

This document reviews core concepts and options available to set up the architecture for multiple brands in your environment.

**Note:** This document applies to the customization of Gen3 of the Sign-In Widget. For information about Gen2, see []

## Domain strategy decision flow

The right multibrand architecture requires that you answer the following questions:

* Do you need Single Sign-On (SSO)?
* How complex are your brand's visual needs?

The following diagram shows the decision flow you should follow when setting up your architectural approach:





## Do you need SSO across brands?

The first architectural decision determines whether you will use domain-level or app-level branding.

### No SSO required

If your brands operate independently and don’t require users to log in once to access all brand-specific apps, you can use domain-level branding within a single Okta org.

In this scenario, all brands share the same underlying Okta login experience (that is, a single Okta domain), and customizations are applied at the domain level.

This approach simplifies management by centralizing user identity and policy enforcement. However, the degree of visual customization across brands is limited to what the core Okta sign-in widget allows.

End-users would have a “Same Login Experience", with the ability to have the same user name, password, email, phone, even OTPs.

**Note:** If you plan to use passkeys, this approach limits you to five associated domains.

The following table lists controls that Okta is responsible for:




#### External context (responsible party)
