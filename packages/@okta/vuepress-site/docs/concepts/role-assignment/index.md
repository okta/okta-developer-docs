title: Role Assignment

# Role assignment

Role assignment to principals makes them administrators of your org. Principals can be users or groups of users. When a role is assigned to a group, all members of the group automatically have the privileges granted by the role.

Roles can be one of the [standard roles](#standard-role-assignment) that are provided by default. Alternatively, you can create your own custom roles by choosing from the collection of available [permissions](#permission-types).

This page discusses the concepts of role assignment through APIs. See [Custom administrator roles](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-cstm-admin-roles).

## Standard role assignment

### Standard role types

The following role types are provided and supported:

| Role type                               | Label                               | Optional targets                      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `API_ACCESS_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN`           | API Access Management administrator |                                       |
| `APP_ADMIN`                             | Application administrator           | Apps                                  |
| `GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_ADMIN`                | Group membership administrator      | [Groups](/docs/reference/api/groups/) |
| `HELP_DESK_ADMIN`                       | Help desk administrator             | [Groups](/docs/reference/api/groups/) |
| `MOBILE_ADMIN`                          | Mobile administrator                |                                       |
| `ORG_ADMIN`                             | Organization administrator        |                                       |
| `READ_ONLY_ADMIN`                       | Read-only administrator             |                                       |
| `REPORT_ADMIN`                          | Report administrator                |                                       |
| `SUPER_ADMIN`                           | Super administrator                 |                                       |
| `USER_ADMIN`                            | Group administrator                 | [Groups](/docs/reference/api/groups/) |

### IAM-based standard role Types
<ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

Okta also supports the following IAM-based standard roles:
| Role type                                                  | Label                               | Permissions                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `ACCESS_CERTIFICATIONS_ADMIN` <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | Access certifications administrator | `okta.governance.accessCertifications.manage` |
| `ACCESS_REQUESTS_ADMIN`       <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | Access requests administrator       | `okta.governance.accessRequests.manage`       |

You can assign IAM-based standard roles using [standard](#standard-role-assignment-steps) or [custom role](#custom-role-assignment) assignment operations. These roles are immutable and can't be updated or deleted.

### Standard Role Assignment steps

Perform a standard role assignment:

1. Assign a role to a user or group. The user now has access to the admin permissions and resources for the role.
2. (Optional) If the role supports targets, use one of the [target operations](/docs/reference/api/roles/#role-target-operations) to indicate which specific resource the admin can manage.

The following are the entities involved in a standard role assignment:

* Role: Identified either by type or ID returned from the [listing API](/docs/reference/api/roles/#list-roles)
* Principal: Either a group or a user
* Resource (optional): When using [target operations](/docs/reference/api/roles/#role-target-operations), the resource can be either an app or a group

## Custom role assignment

You can build custom roles by selecting [Permissions](/docs/reference/api/roles/#permission-types). After a custom role is built, you can use its `id` or `label` to assign to admins:

1. Create a custom role.
2. Create a resource set.
3. Bind the admin with the role from step one that targets the resource set from step two.

An assignment of a role to an admin is called a [Binding](/docs/reference/api/roles/#binding-object), which you can identify by its unique ID. A binding represents a single unique combination of principal, resource set, and custom role. A given resource set can have multiple bindings. The resource allows for different combinations of principals and roles to grant permissions to the encompassing resource.

Therefore, when dealing with custom roles, these three entities always exist:

* Role: Identified by its `label` or `id`
* Principal: Either a group or a user - known as a member of the binding
* Resource set: Identified by its `id`

### Custom role assignment for IAM-based standard roles

<ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

When using IAM-based standard roles the same concepts as custom roles apply with the following distinctions:

* IAM-based standard roles can only be used with predefined resource sets.
* For both IAM-based standard roles and resource sets, thereâ€™s a predefined constant `id`. This `id` is always the `type` of the role or resource set.

| Role id (type)                                          | Applicable resource set id (type)    |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `ACCESS_CERTIFICATIONS_ADMIN` <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | `ACCESS_CERTIFICATIONS_IAM_POLICY` |
| `ACCESS_REQUESTS_ADMIN`       <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | `ACCESS_REQUESTS_IAM_POLICY`       |

### Resource sets

A resource set is simply a collection of resources. There are two types of resource identifiers. Resources can either be identified by an Okta Resource Name (ORN) or by a REST URL format.

#### Okta Resource Name (ORN)

The primary resource identifier is the ORN. ORNs uniquely identify Okta resources.

##### ORN format

ORN identifiers are in the following format:

`orn:{partition}:{service}:{tenantId}:{objectType}:{objectId}`

###### Partitions

The partition is specific to your Okta environment. The following are the supported partitions:

| Partition               |  ORN partition value  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Preview environments    | `oktapreview`         |
| Production environments | `okta`                |

###### Service

  The service that the resource belongs to. Each resource belongs to only one service.
  The following are the supported services:

| Service                                 |  ORN service value      |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Directory                               | `directory`             |
| Identity Provider                       | `idp`                   |
| Workflow                                | `workflow`              |
| Governance <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | `governance`            |

###### tenantId

The identifier for the tenant that is using the service. This is typically your [org ID](/docs/reference/api/org/#org-setting-properties).

###### objectType

The object type that is specific to the service. For example, object types `groups` or `users` are used for the `directory` service. For examples of object types, see
[Supported resources](#supported-resources).

###### objectId

The object's identifier. For examples of object identifiers, see [Supported resources](#supported-resources).

###### contained_resources

The `contained_resources` ORN property indicates to target all resources within the container resource. For example:

`orn:{partition}:directory:{yourOrgId}:groups:123:contained_resources`

Group 123 is the example container resource. Since `:contained_resources` is specified, the resource includes the users in the group, rather than the group itself.

Not all resources support this property, see [Supported resources](#supported-resources) for container resources.

#### REST URL

If the resource has a corresponding Okta API, you can specify the resource by its REST URL. Use the [ORN format](#orn-format) to specify resources that don't have corresponding Okta APIs.

#### Supported resources

> **Note:** If you use a role with permissions that don't apply to the resources in the resource set, it doesn't affect the admin role. For example, the `okta.users.userprofile.manage` permission gives the admin no privileges if itâ€™s granted to a resource set that only includes `https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/{targetGroupId}` resources. If you want the admin to be able to manage the users within the group, the resource set must include the corresponding `https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/{targetGroupId}/users` resource.

> **Note:** Governance resources are currently only supported as part of the [Standard Resource Sets](#standard-resource-sets). You can't use these to create or update other resource sets.

#### Binding member identifiers

To specify binding members, use the REST URL of the corresponding Okta API:

* [A specific user](/docs/reference/api/users/#get-user)

  ```bash
  https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/{memberUserId}
  ```

* [A specific group](/docs/reference/api/groups/#get-group)

  ```bash
  https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/groups/{memberGroupId}
  ```

<ApiLifecycle access="ea" />
* [A specific client application](/docs/reference/api/oauth-clients/#get-an-oauth-client)

  ```bash
  https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/clients/{clientId}
  ```

<ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

The following resource sets are currently supported out of the box and can be used to assign admins only when used with
their associated roles. Standard resource sets and roles are always identified using their type as `id`.
| Resource set id/type                                              | Applicable role id/type    | Resources                                              |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ACCESS_CERTIFICATIONS_IAM_POLICY` <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | `ACCESS_CERTIFICATIONS_ADMIN` | All users, all groups, all Apps, all access certifications    |
| `ACCESS_REQUESTS_IAM_POLICY`       <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | `ACCESS_REQUESTS_ADMIN`       | all users, all groups, all access requests, access request app |
Standard resource sets are managed by Okta only and can't be updated or deleted.

## Custom vs. standard

* An admin can have both standard role assignments and custom role bindings. Privileges granted to an admin are an aggregate of the following:
  * Standard roles directly assigned
  * Standard roles granted through group membership
  * Custom roles directly assigned
  * Custom roles granted through group membership

  As a result, if an admin was granted a standard role that is limited to a single group, and received group management privileges on all groups in the org through a custom role, the ultimate outcome is group management on all groups.

* You can't assign a custom role without a resource set. The custom role is applicable only to a subset of resources. Standard roles, however, are initially granted to the entire org. You can only scope standard roles to specific resources by invoking [target operations](/docs/reference/api/roles/#role-target-operations).

### Permission types

| Permission type                                             | Description                                                                                                                                           | Applicable resource types                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `okta.users.manage`                                         | Allows the admin to create and manage users and read all profile and credential information for users. Delegated admins with this permission can only manage user credential fields and not the credential values themselves. | All users, all users within a specific group |
| `okta.users.create`                                         | Allows the admin to create users. If the admin is also scoped to manage a group, that admin can add the user to the group on creation and then manage.| All groups, a specific group                 |
| `okta.users.read`                                           | Allows the admin to read any user's profile and credential information.
