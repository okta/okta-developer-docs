# Okta Data Model

This page provides a high-level overview of the Okta data model.

Entities inside Okta are referred to as resources. Each Okta resource contains:

* Attributes, such as `name` or `created`.

* Links (URLs) that describe relationships or actions that you can take on the resource. For example, a `self` link on a user references itself, and a `deactivate` link moves the lifecycle state of the user.

* A Profile that allows you to store information about the object. For example, a user profile has an `email` attribute that contains the value for the email address.

When you sign up for Okta, a private data space is created for you that's represented as an organization (org) in Okta. As an Okta customer, you own your org and everything in it: apps, directories, users, groups, policies, and so on.

A top-level directory resource is available for your user base in your org. You can host directories either inside Okta or replicate outside user directories, as in the case of Active Directory or LDAP.

Your end users are modeled inside Okta as [Users](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/). Users are associated with an email address and a username. The username must be unique, but it can be changed (and often is when, for example, someone changes their name). The email address doesn't need to be unique and often isn't. The Okta user ID determines the uniqueness for a user.

A [Group](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/) is made up of users within a directory. It can be thought of as a label that's applied to a set of users. A user can be a member of multiple groups. Groups are useful for representing roles, relationships, and can even be used for subscription tiers.

An [app](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Application/) holds information about the protocol in which it wants Okta to communicate, policies for accessing the app, and which users can use the app after identifying themselves.

The relationship between an app and a user is stored in Okta as an [AppUser](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ApplicationUsers/). This allows for mappings between profile values where they're different. For example, app1 may refer to a user's last name as `lastName` and app2 may refer to last name as `surname`. The AppUser stores the value as necessary for the app.

A [Policy](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Policy/#tag/Policy) specifies the rules of how your org behaves for certain actions. Policies have conditions that need to be met to apply actions. Your Okta org contains policies for how to gain access to an app, what the user needs to do to reset their password, and to enroll into multifactor authentication, for example.

An [authorization server](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/AuthorizationServer/) in your Okta org provides apps tokens that allow those apps to access either your API or Okta resources. This is done with protocols such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML.

A resource that contains other resources is known as a collection. Collections support additional behaviors, such as pagination, sort ordering, and searching. So the user's collection would contain an array of `User` resources. <!--API pointer to collections is a WIP.-->
