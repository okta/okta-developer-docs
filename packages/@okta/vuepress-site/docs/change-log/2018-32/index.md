### Interstitial Page Settings are Generally Available

You can now disable the Okta loading animation that appears during a login redirect to your application. For more information, see [Manage the Okta interstitial page](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Settings/Settings_Customization.htm#CustomInterStitialPage).

### New System Log Event Type for Denied Events

The [System Log](/docs/api/resources/system_log) now reports when requests are denied due to a blacklist rule (such as a IP network zone or location rule). These events are logged with the event type `security.request.blocked`. (OKTA-178982)

### Bugs Fixed in 2018.32

* Fixed a bug that affected delegated authentication users: in rare cases, the user appeared to be active when locked out, or vice versa. (OKTA-180932)
* The Apps API now [returns an error](/docs/api/resources/apps/#response-example-self-service-application-assignment-not-available) if changing the Application's self-service assignment settings could result in an insecure state. (OKTA-182497)
