### User Sessions Deleted after Password Reset

We now delete all sessions for a user after a successful password reset as part of the [forgot password](/docs/api/resources/authn/#forgot-password) flow. <!--OKTA-187076-->

### Bugs Fixed in 2018.38

* An HTTP 500 error would occur if the JSON body sent to create a user contained a non-string value for the following [user profile](/docs/api/resources/users/#profile-object) properties: `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `login`, `mobilePhone`, and `secondEmail`. Any non-string values for these properties will now be converted into strings after they are sent. (OKTA-170711)
