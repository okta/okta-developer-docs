### System Log API Returns Threat Insight Attribute

The `debugContext` object returned by the [System Log API](/docs/api/resources/system_log) can now include an `okta_threat_insight` attribute to indicate that an event has been identified as a security risk. <!--OKTA-198102-->

### Bugs Fixed in 2018.48

* Some customers could access log data outside of their allowed retention range through the [System Log API](/docs/api/resources/system_log). <!--OKTA-196313-->

* Responses from the `/oauth2/${authServerId}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` [endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#well-knownoauth-authorization-server) did not include supported OpenID Connect response types in the content of the `response_types_supported` property. <!--OKTA-114737-->
