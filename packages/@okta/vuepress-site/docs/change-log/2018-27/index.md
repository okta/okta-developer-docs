### System Log API is Generally Available (GA)

The [System Log API](/docs/api/resources/system_log) is now Generally Available. Developers of new projects are strongly recommended to use this in lieu of the Events API.

### Bugs Fixed in 2018.27

* Users who clicked an Activation Link for an [Okta Verify factor](/docs/api/resources/factors/#activate-push-factor) that had already been activated would get back an HTTP 500 error. (OKTA-146511)
* Attempting to add more than the maximum number of zones via the [Zones API](/docs/api/resources/zones) would result in an HTTP 500 error. (OKTA-175991)
