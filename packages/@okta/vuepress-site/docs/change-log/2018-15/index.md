### Enhanced Feature: API Support for Assigning App Instance to App Admins

You can add an app instance target to an `APP_ADMIN` role assignment via the API. Previously an app instance target could be added to the role assignment using the Okta administrators UI only.

When you assign an app instance target to this role assignment, the scope of the role assignment changes from all app targets to just the specified target. Thus you can use this feature to create different `APP_ADMIN` role assignments for different apps in your org.

For details, visit the [Roles API documentation](/docs/api/resources/roles/#add-app-target-to-app-administrator-role). <!-- OKTA-164900 -->

### Bug Fixed in 2018.15

This fix applies if the MFA soft lock for delegated authentication feature is enabled. When a user made multiple failed MFA attempts and was locked out, the user `status` was updated to `ACTIVE` instead of the correct value, `LOCKED_OUT`. (OKTA-164900)
