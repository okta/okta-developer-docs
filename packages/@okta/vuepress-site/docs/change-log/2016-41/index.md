#### Key Store Operations are Available for Identity Providers API

Just as you can in the Apps API, you can perform key store operations in the Identity Providers API:

* Generate an X.509 certificate public key
* Retrieve and list public keys

#### New Function for Replacing Strings

Use the Expression Language function `String.replace` to replace strings.

Example:

`String.replace("This list includes chores", "is", "at") = "That last includes chores"`
<!-- * `String.replaceOnce("This list includes chores", "is", "at") = "That list includes chores"` -->

For more information, see [Expression Language: String Functions](/reference/okta_expression_language/#string-functions).
