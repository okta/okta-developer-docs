## 2016.29

### Feature Enhancements

#### New Response Parameter For Access Token Expiration

<!-- OKTA-94115 -->
The `expires_in` response parameter tells you the number of seconds before a `token` (Access Token) expires. If your
response from the `/oauth2/v1/authorize` endpoint includes an Access Token, `expires_in` is included in the response.

For more information, see the `/oauth2/v1/authorize` [Response Properties](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#response-properties).

#### SHA256 Certificate for New SAML IdP Instances

<!-- OKTA-91496 -->
The default certificate used by new SAML IdP instances to sign assertions is a SHA256 certificate.
Existing SAML IdP instances will continue to use the certificate they currently have.

### Bug Fixed

* Requiring `okta-auth-js` didn't work unless you also defined global variables in the build flow. (OKTA-94206)
