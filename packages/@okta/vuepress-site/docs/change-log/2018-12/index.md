### Change to App Variable Name Incrementing

When creating multiple instances of the same app, each instance of the app has a unique Variable Name. This Variable Name is used as part of the Okta Expression Language. Previously each instance was incrementally numbered (`salesforce_1`, `salesforce_2`, etc), but going forward each instance will instead have a 7-character alphanumeric string appended to its Variable Name. To find your app's Variable Name, go into the Profile Editor for that app. This change only affects newly created apps. <!-- OKTA-158282 -->

### Token Management API Is in Early Access (EA)

Use the Token Management API to view and revoke OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect refresh tokens by [end user](/docs/api/resources/users/#user-oauth-20-token-management-operations), [Custom Authorization Server](/docs/api/resources/authorization-servers#oauth-20-token-management-operations), or [client app](/docs/api/resources/apps/#application-oauth-20-token-operations). <!-- OKTA-145525 -->

### Bug Fixed for 2018.12

* `GET` requests to the `/authorize` [endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#authorize) with `response_mode=form_post` would return an HTML page with a title `<span>`. (OKTA-162709)
