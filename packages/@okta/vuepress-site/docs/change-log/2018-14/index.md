### Linked Objects API in Early Access (EA)

Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the [Linked Objects API](/docs/api/resources/linked-objects).

Okta allows you to create up to 200 linked object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many:

* A manager has many subordinates
* A sales representative has many customers
* A case worker has many clients

Of course, most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the linked object definition once, then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per linked object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one linked object definition.

For more details:

* [Relationships use case](/use_cases/relationships/)
* [Linked Objects API documentation](/docs/api/resources/linked-objects) <!-- OKTA-161674 -->

### Bug Fixed for 2018.14

* If someone was able to obtain a user's activation email or password reset email and attempt to log in before the real user completed logging in, that person could access the account at the same time as the real user. (OKTA-85691)
