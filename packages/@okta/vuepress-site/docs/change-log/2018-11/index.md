### API Support for IdP-initiated Authentication

Use this feature to allow a client to specify the application right away during an authentication request, instead of taking the user through "step-up" authentication in a separate request. [Documentation](/docs/api/resources/authn/#sp-initiated-step-up-authentication) <!-- OKTA-160275 -->

### New Powershell Module for TLS 1.2 Compatibility

The new version of Okta's Powershell module is compatible with TLS 1.2. [Documentation](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Okta.Core.Automation/1.0.1)<!-- OKTA-161239 -->

### Rate Limit for System Log Increased

The rate limit for GET requests to `/api/v1/logs` has been increased from 60 per minute to 120. [Documentation](/docs/api/getting_started/rate-limits#okta-api-endpoints-and-per-minute-limits)

### New Version of Okta Sign-in Widget

Version 2.7.0 of the Okta Sign-in Widget provides new features, notable changes, and bug fixes. For details, visit [the `okta-signin-widget` repository](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/releases).

### Bugs Fixed for 2018.11

* An incorrect error message was returned when a blank password was specified in a password reset request. (OKTA-144982)
* If administrators in an org with the Developer Console enabled used the Classic user interface instead, and had no apps assigned, they couldn't access their own user home page. (OKTA-152324)
* For [the System Log API](/docs/api/resources/system_log), the `displayName` in the Target object was set to `Unknown` if the `eventType` was `user.authentication.sso` and if the value didn't exist in the profile editor.
This behavior matches the behavior in `/events`. (OKTA-156484)
