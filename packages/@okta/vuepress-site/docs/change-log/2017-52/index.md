#### Token Preview

Configuring an application or integration to use OpenID Connect  ID tokens or OAuth 2.0 access tokens can take a lot of trial-and-error.
Okta has made it easier to choose configuration settings and see the resulting tokens in the **Token Preview** tab of the Authorization Server page:

![Screen shot of token preview tab](/img/release_notes/token_preview.png "Screen shot of token preview tab")

Add values on the left side to see how they would affect the token on the right. All the fields are selection boxes except User.
For User, type in the first few letters to see a choice of user names.

You can try out different combinations of values, and see the resulting tokens (or error messages).
Once you've got the right combination, it's easy to configure your authorization server and other components. <!-- OKTA-149604 -->

#### New Values for `amr` Base Claim

We improved some behaviors related for base claim `amr`:

* When [MFA factors `sms` or `call`](/docs/api/resources/factors/#factor-type) are used, the `amr` claim returns [`mca`](/docs/api/resources/sessions/#amr-object).
* When [MFA factor `token:hardware`](/docs/api/resources/factors/#factor-type) is used, the `amr` claim returns `hwk`.
* When [MFA factor `web`](/docs/api/resources/factors/#factor-type) is used, the `amr` claim returns `swk`. <!-- OKTA-152175 -->

### Bug Fix: Legacy Events Available in System Log

This bug fix is expected in preview orgs starting December 28, 2017 and expected in production orgs starting January 8, 2017.

The following legacy events, already present in the `/api/v1/events` endpoint, are also available in the `/api/v1/logs` endpoint (System Log API):

* `app.auth.slo.with_reason`
* `app.auth.slo.saml.malformed_request.invalid_type`
* `app.keys.clone_legacy`
* `app.keys.generate_legacy`
* `app.keys.rotate_legacy`
