### System Log Entry Delay Change

Events returned from the `/logs` endpoint when using the `until` parameter were previously delayed by up to 1 second. To improve the performance of our System Log, queries to the `/logs` endpoint that include an `until` parameter may now return results that are delayed up to 10 seconds. When making requests with an `until` value that is near real-time, ensure that you allow enough of a buffer as to not miss events (e.g. 20s).

### Bug Fixed in 2018.20

* Group search queries with underscores returned incorrect results. (OKTA-164390)
