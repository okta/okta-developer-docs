# Okta API Products Change Log

This change log lists customer-visible changes to API Products by release number. Okta releases every week except a few times a year we skip
a release, usually due to holiday schedules or other special events. We release first to preview orgs and then production orgs.

Dates for preview and production release are the earliest possible release date. Always check your org to verify the release for your org.

To verify the current release for an org, check the footer of the administrator UI. If necessary, click the **Admin** button to navigate to your administrator UI.
