### Bugs Fixed in 2018.44

* Temporary passwords returned by the `/users/${userId}/lifecycle/expire_password` [endpoint](/docs/api/resources/users/#expire-password) sometimes included hard-to-distinguish characters.
* Queries to the `/logs` [endpoint](/docs/api/resources/system_log#list-events) with `since` and `until` values that were both earlier than the customer's data retention period would return an HTTP 500 error.
