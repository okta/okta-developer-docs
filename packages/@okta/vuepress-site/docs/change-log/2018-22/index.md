### New Session Token Behavior is in Early Access

If a user has a valid session and passes a `sessionToken`, this `sessionToken` will override any existing session cookie. If the user has a valid session but passes an invalid `sessionToken`, then their existing session will be invalidated. Currently, if a user has a valid session and passes a `sessionToken`, the `sessionToken` will be ignored. If this feature is not enabled, the current behavior will continue. <!-- OKTA-152261 -->

### System Log Events for New Device Notification Emails

New device notification email events will now appear in the System Log. <!-- OKTA-170405 -->

### Bugs Fixed in 2018.22

* Default password policy settings were sometimes incorrectly applied when creating a user with a password. (OKTA-127830)
* The `/userinfo` [endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#userinfo) would return an empty JSON object in the response body when using an invalid access token. (OKTA-169553)
* Some OAuth 2.0/OIDC refresh tokens would expire early. (OKTA-171056)
