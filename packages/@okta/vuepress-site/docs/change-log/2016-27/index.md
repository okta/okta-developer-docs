## 2016.27

### Feature Enhancements

#### Improvements for OAuth Panels in the Administrator Console

<!-- OKTA-93256 -->
To improve usability, we've moved some of the panels in the administrator UI related to OAuth:

* The **OAuth** tab has been renamed **Authorization Server**.
* The **Signing credentials rotation** option was on the **Client Registration** panel, but since it helps you configure tokens, we've
 moved it to the **Authorization Server** tab.

#### Okta Sign-In Widget Updated

<!-- OKTA-91831, OKTA-93759 -->
The Okta Sign-In Widget will be updated to version 1.4.0 for Production orgs.

See [Okta Sign-In Widget](/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/) for updated sample code.

The new release includes several enhancements:

* The new version is an npm module and is availabe on the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-signin-widget).
* Changes to the "Trust this Device" checkbox and other minor bug fixes have been made.

#### Improved User Lookup for Password Recovery

<!-- OKTA-92001 -->
To ensure a successful password recovery lookup if an email address is associated with multiple users, we improved the lookup behavior:

* Okta no longer includes deactivated users in the lookup.
* The lookup searches login IDs first, then primary email addresses, and then secondary email addresses.

### Bugs Fixed

* The OIDC Access Token was incorrectly available to Okta endpoints other than `/oauth2/v1/userinfo`. (OKTA-91099)
* The format of the issuer (`iss`) in the Access Token has changed: it was the client ID. It now takes the form: `https://{yourOktaDomain}.okta.com/as/{authorization-server-ID}. (OKTA-93628)
