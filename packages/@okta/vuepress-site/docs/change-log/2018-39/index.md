### Bugs Fixed in 2018.39

* Requests to the `/authorize` endpoint would incorrectly prioritize values from the URI query parameter, rather than the request JWT. For more information, see the [documentation for that endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#authorize). (OKTA-187642)
* When multiple attempts were simultaneously made to update a user's phone number for the [SMS](/docs/api/resources/factors/#enroll-okta-sms-factor) or [Call](/docs/api/resources/factors/#enroll-okta-call-factor) Factor, an HTTP 500 error was sometimes returned. (OKTA-188112)
* In some situations SHA-256 [password imports](/docs/api/resources/users/#hashed-password-object) would not work. SHA-256 password import now requires the salt to be base64-encoded.
