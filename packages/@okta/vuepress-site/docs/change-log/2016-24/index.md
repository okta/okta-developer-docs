#### Disable Automatic Key Rotation
If you need to disable automatic key rotation for an OpenID Connect flow, you can do so in General Settings section under the General tab for an app, and then use the `/oauth2/v1/keys` endpoint to fetch public keys for your app. For more information, see [OpenID Connect](/docs/api/resources/oidc).

### Bugs Fixed

* OKTA-69173 - The `helpURL` for `vpn` wasn't returned even though it had been set previously in a request to `/api/v1/apps`.
