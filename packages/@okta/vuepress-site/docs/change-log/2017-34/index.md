#### Zones API is an Early Access Release
<!-- OKTA-129115 -->

Zones are used to group IP Address ranges so that policy decisions can be made based on the client's IP location.

[The Zones API](/docs/api/resources/zones) is an <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> release. Contact [Support](https://support.okta.com/help/open_case) to enable it.

### API Bug Fixes

Bug fixes are expected on preview orgs starting August 22, 2017, and on production orgs starting Sept 5, 2017.

* OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 client apps with an `application_type` of `native` or `browser` incorrectly allowed the `client_credentials` grant type. This fix adheres to the [OAuth 2.0 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). (OKTA-135853)
* Requests to `GET /api/v1/apps/${applicationId}/groups?expand=group%2Cmetadata` caused an error in orgs with the Application Entitlements Policy enabled. (OKTA-135969)
* The `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` attribute in a SAML authentication requests matched one of the configured SSO URLs but an error was returned. (OKTA-137555)
