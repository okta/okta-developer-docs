title: Find your Okta domain
---

To find your Okta URL (also called an Okta domain):

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.

   > **Note:** Make sure that you are using the Developer Console. If you see **Classic UI** in the top left of the page, click it and select **Developer Console** to switch.

2. Look for the Okta domain in the upper-right corner of the dashboard:

Your Okta domain looks like:

* `example.oktapreview.com`
* `example.okta.com`
* `example.okta-emea.com`

See [Okta Organizations](/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/) for more information on the types of Okta orgs.
