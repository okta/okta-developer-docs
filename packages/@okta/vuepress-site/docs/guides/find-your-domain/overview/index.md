If you're building an application using one of our SDKs or client libraries, you may run into the following message:

> **Note:** Your Okta URL is missing. Replace `{yourOktaDomain}` with your Okta domain. You can copy your domain from the Okta Developer Console.

Okta orgs host pages on subdomains and each org is assigned a URL. The typical org URL is the tenant name (the subdomain), and then the domain name.
