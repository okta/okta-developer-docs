The following sections outline the requests required to implement the out-of-band (OOB) flow (with SMS or Voice) using direct calls to the Okta OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 API.

### Request for out-of-band authentication

Before you can begin this flow, collect the username from the user in a manner of your choosing. Then, make an API call to the Okta [authorization server](/docs/concepts/auth-servers/) `/oob-authenticate` endpoint. Use this endpoint to initiate an authentication flow with an out-of-band factor (such as SMS or Voice) as the primary factor.

> **Note:** The `/oob-authenticate` endpoint doesn't support multifactor authentication.

Your request should look something like this:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/oob-authenticate \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'client_id=${client_id}&login_hint=${testuser%40example.com}&channel_hint=${sms or voice}'
```

Note the parameters that are passed:

- `client_id`: Matches the client ID of the application that you created in the [Set up your app](#set-up-your-app) section. You can find it at the top of your app's **General** tab.
- `login_hint`: The email username of a registered Okta user
- `channel_hint`: The out-of-band channel that the client wants to use. For Phone, use `sms` or `voice`.

For more information on these parameters, see the `/oob-authenticate` [endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/OrgAS/#tag/OrgAS/operation/oob-authenticate).

### OOB response example

In an HTTP 200 response, Okta returns the following parameters:

> **Note:** Okta also sends a push notification to the user.

**SMS**

```json
  {
      "oob_code": "ftwG4adUWWIV_hJi3OjYeE7PlIVia-aN3B",
      "expires_in": 300,
      "channel": "sms",
      "binding_method": "prompt"
  }
```

**Voice**

```json
  {
      "oob_code": "ftpvP1LB26vCARL7EWM55cUhPA2vdQmHFp",
      "expires_in": 300,
      "channel": "voice",
      "binding_method": "prompt",
  }
```

Note the parameters included:

- `oob_code`: An identifier of a single out-of-band factor transaction. To respond to or check on the status of an out-of-band factor, use this code to identify the factor transaction.
- `expires_in`: The time, in seconds, until the `oob_code` expires
- `channel`: The type of out-of-band channel used. For Phone, it's either `sms` or `voice`.
- `binding_method`: The method used to bind the out-of-band channel with the primary channel. SMS and Voice Factors use `prompt`.

### Request for tokens

After the user responds to the prompt for the OTP code, the app makes a request to the `/token` endpoint.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/token \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'client_id=${client_id}&scope=openid%20profile&grant_type=urn:okta:params:oauth:grant-type:oob&oob_code=${oob_code}&binding_code=${binding_code}'
```

Note the parameters that are passed:

- `client_id`: Matches the client ID of the app that you created in the [Set up your app](#set-up-your-app) section. You can find it at the top of your app's **General** tab.
- `scope`: Must be at least `openid`. See the **Create Scopes** section of the [Create an authorization server guide](/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/main/#create-scopes).
- `grant_type`: `urn:okta:params:oauth:grant-type:oob`, which indicates that you're using the direct authentication OOB grant type. Use this grant type for OOB factors that you want to use as a primary factor.
- `oob_code`: An identifier of a single out-of-band factor transaction. To respond to or check on the status of an out-of-band factor, use this code to identify the factor transaction.
- `binding_code`: The end user verification code used to bind the authorization operation on the secondary channel with the primary channel.

### Okta token response

Okta responds with the required tokens.

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiO[.....]Zpx4fch2n-cdQ",
    "scope": "openid profile",
    "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJFVkRZ[.....]GKwhgZa3TdIfCXA"
}
```
