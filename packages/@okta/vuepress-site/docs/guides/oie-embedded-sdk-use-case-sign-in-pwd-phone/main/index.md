**Learning outcomes**

Understand how to implement a user sign-in flow with password and phone factors.

**What you need**

* An app that uses the embedded Okta Identity Engine SDK
* [Okta org already configured for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case)
* [Identity Engine SDK set up for your own app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/)

## Configuration updates

This sign-in use case requires the password and phone factors.

 "Password and phone factors")

Before you build a sign-in flow with password and phone factors, you need to configure the Okta org to accept both factors in your app. See [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case) to configure your app and Okta org for this use case.

### Set phone as optional for authentication enrollment

The instructions in [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case) enables both email and phone factors as optional for enrollment. For this use case, you need to enable the phone factor as optional and disable the email factor.

1. In the Admin console, go to **Security** > **Authenticators**.
1. On the **Authenticators** page, select the **Enrollment** tab.
1. In **Default Policy**, click **Edit**.
1. In the **Edit Policy** dialog box, under **Effective Factors**:
   * Set **Email Authentication** to **Disabled**.
   * Set **Phone Authentication** to **Optional**.
1. Click **Update Policy** if a value has changed.
