title: Before you begin
---
This guide shows you how to use Okta as the user store for your web application and sign users in.

If you are building a single-page (browser) app, see [Sign users in to your single-page application](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/) instead. Or, if you are building a server that returns API responses (but not HTML), see [Protect your API endpoints](/docs/guides/protect-your-api/).

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).
* Know the basics of building Web applications.
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.
* Are building a web app that's rendered by a server.

If you don't have an existing app, or are new to building apps, start with this documentation:
