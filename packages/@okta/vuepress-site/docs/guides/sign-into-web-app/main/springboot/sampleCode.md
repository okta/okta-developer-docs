Java Spring Boot &mdash; see our [Spring Boot Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/samples-java-spring/tree/master/okta-hosted-login) for a working sample app, or check out [Spring Boot Getting Started Guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) if you want to build your own to work through this guide with. You can directly create a new Spring Boot project with Okta by visiting the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) and selecting the dependencies **Web** and **Okta**, then clicking **Generate Project** to download a zip file.
