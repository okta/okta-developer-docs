If you created your application with the Spring Initializr on the <GuideLink link="../before-you-begin/">first page of this guide</GuideLink>, this dependency has already been added.

For existing applications, you can add the Okta Spring Boot Starter by including the following Apache Maven dependency: 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```
