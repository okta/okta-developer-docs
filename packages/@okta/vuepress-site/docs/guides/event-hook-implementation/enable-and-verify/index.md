title: Enable and verify Event Hook
---
The Event Hook must be set up and verified within your Okta Admin Console.

### Set up the Event Hook

1. Sign in to your [Okta org](https://login.okta.com/).

2. From the Admin Console, go to **Workflow** > **Event Hooks**.

3. Click **Create Event Hook**. The **Add Event Hook Endpoint** dialog box opens.

4. In the **Name** field, add a unique name for the Hook (in this example, "Deactivated User Event Hook").

5. In the **URL** field, add your external service URL, including endpoint. For example, use your Glitch project name with the endpoint: `https://your-glitch-projectname.glitch.me/userDeactivated`.

6. Include authentication field and secret. In this example:

    - **Authentication field** = `authorization`

    - **Authentication secret** = `Basic YWRtaW46c3VwZXJzZWNyZXQ=`

7. In the **REQUESTS** section of the dialog box, subscribe to the Event Type you want to monitor. In this example, a user deactivated in the Okta org: `User deactivated`.

8. Click **Save & Continue**.

9. You can complete the one-time verification Okta call at this time or verify the Event Hook later. If you are using the Glitch example, proceed to verification.

> **Note:** You can also set up an Event Hook using an API. See [Event Hooks Management](/docs/reference/api/event-hooks/#create-event-hook) for further information.

### Verify the Event Hook

You must verify the Event Hook to prove that your external service controls the endpoint. See [One-Time Verification Request](/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#one-time-verification-request) for further information on this process.

To complete the one-time verification of the Event Hook:

- After creating the Event Hook, and if your external service is ready to handle the request, click **Verify** to complete the one-time verification step.

or

- After making sure that your external service is ready for the external verification call, go to the Event Hooks table, click the **Actions** drop-down menu of any **UNVERIFIED** Event Hook, and select **Verify**.

The Event Hook is now set up with a status of **VERIFIED** and is ready to send Event Hook calls to your external service.
