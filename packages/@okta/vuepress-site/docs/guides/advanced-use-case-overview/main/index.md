Okta’s Embedded solutions support various architectures, use cases, and customization needs. These guides cover the more advanced use cases, where you may have specific requirements for your system architecture and overall users’ experience.

## Custom password recovery

Okta's embedded solutions allow you to customize your authentication use cases with full support for theming, branding, and extensive ways to control the user experience. The <StackSnippet snippet="customsspr" inline /> covers customizations for one particular use case, self-service password recovery, where an email authenticator is used to verify the user before they can reset their password.

## Device context

Okta’s Embedded solutions support Okta’s Adaptive Multifactor Authentication (AMFA) when your architecture uses middleware server-side applications as trusted clients. In this architecture, your applications pass device information to Okta to enable AMFA. Learn more about supporting AMFA using device context with the <StackSnippet snippet="devicecontext" inline /> .
