The [Golang getting started guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) teaches you how to get started with Golang and create your first app.

Or, if you want to skip this guide and just download a working sample app, download our [Go Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/samples-golang/tree/develop/okta-hosted-login).

You will want to make sure your application is set up with [Go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)
