1. Add the following code to handle the `/profile` route in `app.js`, just below the previous code you added:

   ```js
   app.use('/profile', (req, res) => {
     res.render('profile', { user: req.user });
   });
   ```

2. Add a new template file called `views/profile.pug` that contains the following code:

   ```pug
   extends layout

   block content
     h2= "My Profile"
     br
     div
       p Hello, #{user.displayName}.
   ```
