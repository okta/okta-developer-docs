1. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
1. Click **Sign In**. The browser redirects you to Okta to sign in using the Sign-In Widget.
1. After you’ve signed in, you’re redirected to the profile page. This displays the user information returned by Okta in the ID token.
1. Click **Sign Out**. The browser returns you to the home page.
