## Summary

Access tokens often have limited lifetimes. Allowing access
tokens to expire limits their usefulness in case they are discovered
by an attacker. In order for your app to continue to use the
appropriate resources when an access token expires, it can refresh
them without user intervention through the use of a refresh token.

All the SDKs expose functionality that allow you
to obtain access, ID, and refresh tokens. Depending on the SDK (Swift,
Javascript, and so on), you have varying degrees of convenience
methods and other functionality that provide you with built-in support
for token refresh, auto-renewal, and storage.  Minimally,
all the SDKs allow you to obtain the refresh token and call the authorization
server's token endpoint to renew the access token.

## Option 2: Refresh the token using the OAuth token endpoint

You can refresh access and ID tokens using the
[`/token`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#token)
endpoint with the `grant_type` set to `refresh_token`. Before calling this endpoint,
obtain the refresh token from the SDK and ensure that you have included
`offline_access` as a scope in the SDK configurations. For further details on
access token refresh with this endpoint, see
[Use a refresh token](/docs/guides/refresh-tokens/use-refresh-token/).

### Native and SPA applications

Unlike web applications, native applications and single-page applications (SPAs)
don't use client secrets. As a result, token refresh requests for these
applications omit the `Authorization` header and instead include the
`client_id` query parameter.

Example

```http
POST /oauth2/default/v1/token HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token
redirect_uri=com.embeddedauth://callback
scope=offline_access openid profile
refresh_token=03_hBtVj-Hk0Mxo9TPSdl7TLkxQioKqQEzud3ldqHqs
client_id=0oa94el1z4nUDxx0z5d7
```

### Response

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJoQkZNR...",
    "scope": "offline_access openid profile",
    "refresh_token": "HRzOBfj1A1g6akWqNHfCE-KX-9NASmnFqhRFOt_rEdc",
    "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJoQkZN..."
}
```

## Get the token info using the introspect endpoint

To learn more information about tokens (access or Id) including whether
they have expired, use the
[`/introspect`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect)
endpoint.
