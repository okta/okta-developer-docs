title: Refresh the access and ID tokens
---

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

This guide shows you how to refresh access and ID tokens by using either the Identity Engine SDK or the OIDC & OAuth 2.0 API.

---

#### Learning outcome

* Understand how access and ID tokens have a limited lifetime.
* Know how to use refresh tokens when access and ID tokens expire.

#### What you need

* An [Okta org that is already configured for your use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/)
* An [Identity Engine SDK that is set up for your own app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/)
* An app that uses an Identity Engine SDK that is configured with an `offline_access` scope

## Overview

Access tokens often have limited lifetimes. If you allow access tokens to expire, their usefulness is limited in the event an attacker discovers them. Your app can refresh expired tokens by using a refresh token. The app can then continue using the appropriate resources without user intervention.

All the SDKs expose functionality that allows you to obtain access, ID, and refresh tokens. Each SDK (Swift, JavaScript, and so on) has a different set of methods and functionality that provide built-in support for token refresh, auto-renewal, and storage. Minimally, all the SDKs allow you to obtain the refresh token and call the authorization server's token endpoint to renew the access token.

## Refresh the tokens

You can refresh tokens with the SDK or with the OAuth token endpoint.

### Refresh the tokens with the SDK

### Refresh the tokens with the OAuth token endpoint

You can refresh access and ID tokens using the [`/token`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/CustomAS/#tag/CustomAS/operation/tokenCustomAS) endpoint with the `grant_type` set to `refresh_token`. Before calling this endpoint, obtain the refresh token from the SDK and ensure that you've included `offline_access` as a scope in the SDK configurations. For further details on access token refresh with this endpoint, see [Use a refresh token](/docs/guides/refresh-tokens/main/#use-a-refresh-token).

#### Platform-specifc and SPA apps

OIDC and OAuth 2.0 requests for platform-specific and single-page apps (SPAs) don't include the `Authorization` header with the client ID and secret. Instead, these apps include the `client_id` query parameter in their requests.

##### Request example

```http
POST /oauth2/default/v1/token HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token
redirect_uri=com.embeddedauth://callback
scope=offline_access openid profile
refresh_token=03_hBtVj-Hk0Mxo9TPSdl7TLkxQioKqQEzud3ldqHqs
client_id=0oa94el1z4nUDxx0z5d7
```

##### Response example

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJoQkZNR...",
    "scope": "offline_access openid profile",
    "refresh_token": "HRzOBfj1A1g6akWqNHfCE-KX-9NASmnFqhRFOt_rEdc",
    "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJoQkZN..."
}
```

## Use the introspect endpoint to get token info

To get information on a current token, such as if the token is active or has expired, use the [`/introspect`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/CustomAS/#tag/CustomAS/operation/introspectCustomAS) endpoint.
