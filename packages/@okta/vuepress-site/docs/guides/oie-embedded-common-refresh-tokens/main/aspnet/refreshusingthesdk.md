## Option 1: Refresh tokens using the .Net SDK

The [.Net SDK, Widget, and sample app](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-dotnet)
don't currently have built-in support for refreshing tokens. Instead use
the direct approach with the [OAuth token endpoint](#refresh-the-token-using-the-oauth-token-endpoint).
