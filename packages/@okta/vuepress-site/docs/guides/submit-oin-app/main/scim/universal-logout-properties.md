Universal logout properties

Universal Logout integrations are only supported for SAML 2.0 and OIDC protocols. If you want to submit a Universal Logout integration with SCIM provisioning, you must also submit an SSO integration with either SAML 2.0 or OIDC. For more information, see [Universal Logout](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oin-universal-logout-overview).
