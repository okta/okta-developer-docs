Before you can test your Okta-SCIM integration, you need to first test your SCIM API service. Okta provides a SCIM API specification test suite to execute in Runscope. See [Test your SCIM API](/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-prepare/main/#test-your-scim-api).

After you've successfully run the Okta SCIM API specification test suite in Runscope, save the URL of the test results. This Runscope test results URL is one of the requirements to submit your integration.
