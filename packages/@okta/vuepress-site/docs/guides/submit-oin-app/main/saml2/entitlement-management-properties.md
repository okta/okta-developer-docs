> **Notes:**
> * Entitlement Management is an *Early Access* feature and it’s currently supported for integrations that manage entitlements through a SCIM server. To enable this feature in the OIN Admin Console, go to **Settings** > **Features** and turn on **Enable SCIM 2.0 Entitlement Management submission**.
> * The **SCIM Entitlement Management properties** section only appears when you select **Entitlement Management** from the **Identity Lifecycle Management** section. This selection must be made along with the protocols that your integration supports.
> * For instructions on configuring Entitlement Management properties, see [Configure Entitlement Management properties](/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/scim/main/#scim-2-0-entitlement-management-properties).
