With Express Configuration, admins can quickly set up SCIM for an instance of your app in Okta. During the process, these default settings are applied to the new Okta Workforce connection in Auth0. See [Configure Inbound SCIM](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/scim/configure-inbound-scim) for more information.

* **Sync user profiles using SCIM** is enabled.
* A new token is generated in the **Setup** tab.
