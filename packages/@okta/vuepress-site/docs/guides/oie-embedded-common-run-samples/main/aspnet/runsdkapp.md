1. If you haven't already done so, [set up your Okta org for a password factor only use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-password-factor-only-use-case).
1. If you haven't already done so, [download and set up the sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/).
1. Locate the sample apps solution file in the following path:

1. Open `embedded-auth-with-sdk.sln` using Visual Studio.
1. Right-click the `embedded-auth-with-sdk` project, which is the sample app, and select **Set as startup project**.
1. Add an `okta.yaml` configuration file. See [Option 1: Create a configuration file](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/#option-1-create-a-configuration-file) for more information on how to configure and where to place the configuration file.
1. Click Visual Studio's play button and run the solution. The default web browser should open and navigate to the app's home page. The URL should be `https://localhost:44314`, which is the default address when using IISExpress.
1. After the app loads, click **Sign In**, which is located on the app's home page.
1. On the sign-in page, enter the username (email) and password that you used in [Create your Okta account](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#create-your-okta-account):
