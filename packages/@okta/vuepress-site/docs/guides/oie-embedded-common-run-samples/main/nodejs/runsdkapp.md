1. If you haven't already done so, [set up your Okta org](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-password-factor-only-use-case).
1. If you haven't already done so, [download and set up the sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/nodejs/main/).
1. Locate the sample app in the following directory:
`okta-auth.js/samples/generated/express-embedded-auth-with-sdk` and ensure the module dependencies are installed. See [Install the module dependencies](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/nodejs/main/#install-the-module-dependencies).
1. Open the embedded SDK sample application directory using Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE.
1. Add a `testenv` configuration file. See [Option 1: Create a configuration file](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/nodejs/main/#option-1-create-a-configuration-file) for further information.
1. From the terminal, navigate to the `express-embedded-sign-in-widget` sample directory and run the application: `npm run start`. This process sets the environment variables and starts the web server. Verify on the console that the environment variables are set.
1. Open a browser window and navigate to the app's home page: `http://localhost:8080`. After the app loads, click the **Sign In** button located on the home page.
1. On the sign-in page, enter the username (email) and password you used in [Create your Okta account](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#create-your-okta-account).
1. Click **Sign In**. If you've successfully signed in, the app redirects you to the user profile page that displays basic user profile and security token information.

### Troubleshoot

* If the Widget doesn't load, verify that you have properly set up your local configurations. Follow the steps in [Set the configuration values](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/nodejs/main/#set-the-configuration-values).

* If the "There was an unexpected internal error. Please try again." message appears instead of the Sign-In Widget, then verify that CORS is enabled. Follow the steps in [Add a trusted origin and enable CORS](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#add-a-trusted-origin-and-enable-cors) to enable CORS.

### Work with the use cases

After you successfully run the sample app, you can build your own integration by using the sample app as your guide. Explore use cases that are available with the SDK, starting with the [Basic sign-in flow using the password factor](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-in/nodejs/main/) use case.
