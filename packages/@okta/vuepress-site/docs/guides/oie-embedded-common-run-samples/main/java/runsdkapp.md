> **Note:** The Okta Java SDK embedded authentication sample app uses the Spring Boot framework. See [Spring Boot Getting Started](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) for more information on Spring.

1. [Set up your Okta org for a password factor only use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/java/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-password-factor-only-use-case).

1. Obtain app-specific configuration values (such as `${clientId}`, `${clientSecret}`, `${yourOktaDomain}`) from the app integration you've created in [Create new application](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/java/main/#create-a-new-application).

1. From your command shell, locate the embedded authentication SDK sample app source files in the following path: `...\okta-idx-java\samples\embedded-auth-with-sdk`.

1. Set the app-specific environment variables:<br>
   ```bash
   export OKTA_IDX_ISSUER=https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
   export OKTA_IDX_CLIENTID=${clientId}
   export OKTA_IDX_CLIENTSECRET=${clientSecret}
   export OKTA_IDX_SCOPES="openid profile offline_access"
   export OKTA_IDX_REDIRECTURI=http://localhost:8080
   ```

1. Execute `mvn` from the `...\okta-idx-java\samples\embedded-auth-with-sdk\` sample app root directory.

1. Navigate to the sample app's home page on your browser: `http://localhost:8080`. <br>The Welcome to the Okta Samples for Java page appears with your app's configuration values.

1. Click **Login** on the welcome page.
1. Enter the **Username** and **Password** for the user that you've created in
   [Create your Okta account](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/java/main/#create-your-okta-account).

1. Click **Login**. After you've successfully signed in, the app redirects you to a page that displays your basic user profile and security token information.

1. Click **Logout** in the upper-right corner of the page to sign out of the sample app.

### Work with the use cases

After you successfully run the sample app, you can build your own integration by using the sample app as your guide. Explore use cases that are available with the SDK, starting with the [Basic sign-in flow using the password factor](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-in/java/main/) use case.
