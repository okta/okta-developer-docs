After you [create and set up your Okta org](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/) and [download and set up the sample app and SDK](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/), you can take the next step to test the SDK sample app.

<StackSelector snippet="testapp" noSelector />

## Work with the use cases

After you have successfully run the sample app, you can build your own integration by using the sample app as your guide. See [Start with a use case overview](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-overview/) to explore the use cases that are available with the SDK.
