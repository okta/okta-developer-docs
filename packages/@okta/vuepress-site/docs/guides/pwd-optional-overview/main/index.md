## Overview

Most hacking-related breaches involve weak or stolen passwords and credential security theft. Passwords are a security vulnerability because they can be easily stolen and are prone to phishing attacks. They're also not convenient. Users often need to remember multiple passwords, change them regularly, and either memorize or store them securely somewhere.

Replace the password with a password-optional sign-in experience. Give your users the ability to authenticate with a fingerprint, YubiKey, email, phone, or another authenticator. These authenticators are all more secure &mdash; it's harder to steal a fingerprint than a password &mdash; and more convenient since users no longer have to memorize and manage their passwords.
