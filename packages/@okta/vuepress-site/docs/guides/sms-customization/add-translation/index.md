title: Add a translation
---

If you support other languages in your org, you need to create a translation for each language to match your <GuideLink link="../customize-default-sms">new custom SMS message</GuideLink>. You also need to provide the translated text for each message.

1. In the Developer Console, go to **Customizations**, and then **Emails & SMS**.

2. Select the **SMS** tab.

3. Click **Add Translation**.

4. In the **Add Translation** dialog box, select the language from the **Language** drop-down box.

5. Enter the message, in the translated language, into the box.

For example: `it": "${org.name}: il codice di verifica Ã¨ ${code}`

6. Click **Add Translation**.

> **Note:** If you are adding a translation for the Okta Default SMS message, after you add that translation, you are no longer using the Default message. The new language translation appears under what is now your custom SMS message.

7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 for each language that your org supports.

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can use the [Okta Templates API](/docs/reference/api/templates/) to manage custom SMS message templates.
