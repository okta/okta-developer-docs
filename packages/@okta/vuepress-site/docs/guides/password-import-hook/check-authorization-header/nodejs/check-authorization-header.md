For the check of the Authorization header here, we use Node packages to parse the request from Okta and to decode the Authorization header.

We chose to use the Basic Authentication scheme to encode a username and password combination in base64 to serve as the content of the Authorization header.

If the Authorization header is missing or the value provided is wrong, we deny the request, returning an HTTP 401 "Unauthorized" status code.

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(basicAuth({
  users: { 'admin': 'supersecret' },
  unauthorizedResponse: req => 'Unauthorized'
}));
```
