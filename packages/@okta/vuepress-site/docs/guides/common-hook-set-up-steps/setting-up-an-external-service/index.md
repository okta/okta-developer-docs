title: Setting up an external service
---

The Event Hook and Inline Hook examples in this section use Glitch.com projects to create an external service for use with your Okta org.

[Glitch](https://www.glitch.com) is a browser-based development environment that can build a full-stack web application online. You can use their template applications to implement an external service that receives the outbound calls from Okta orgs.

Start with a new Node.js project built on the Express framework or a Node.js SQLite database application and use the code snippets in the following examples to implement the example hooks. Copy (**Remix on Glitch**) the Glitch projects for each hook in the following sections to have a working code sample.
