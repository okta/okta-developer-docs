title: Adding Basic Authorization and Body Parsing
---

The Glitch project templates do not have any authorization or body parsing code. To include this content:

* Add the Body Parser and Basic Auth `npm` packages to your Glitch project
* Add the code snippet below

If you Remix a Glitch Inline Hook project, the packages and code are already included.

To add the `npm` packages:

1. Click on the `package.json` file in the left-hand project menu.
2. From the `Add Package` drop-down, search for the `express-basic-auth` and `body-parser` packages.
3. Click each package to add to your project.

The Inline Hook guides use [HTTP Basic Authentication](/books/api-security/authn/api-authentication-options/#http-basic-authentication) to authenticate the Okta Inline Hook API calls received by your Glitch external service. In your Okta org, the Glitch project username and password credentials must be encoded in Base64 and added as the **Authentication secret** when you activate the Inline Hook. Ensure you add the scheme `Basic ` (including a space) as a prefix to the **Authentication secret** value.

For example, the credential pair used in the Inline Hook examples is `admin:supersecret`, which encoded in Base64 is `YWRtaW46c3VwZXJzZWNyZXQ=`. Adding the scheme to this value, creates the Inline Hook **Authentication secret** value: `Basic YWRtaW46c3VwZXJzZWNyZXQ=`.

After including the `npm` packages, add the following code snippet in your project.
