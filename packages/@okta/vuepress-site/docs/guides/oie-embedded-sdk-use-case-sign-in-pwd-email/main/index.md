## Configuration updates

Before you build a sign-in flow with password and email factors, you need to configure the Okta org to accept both factors in your app. See [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case) to configure your app and Okta org for this use case.

### Set email as optional for authentication enrollment

 The instructions in [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case) enables both email and phone factors as optional for enrollment. For this use case, you need to enable the email factor as optional and disable the phone factor.
