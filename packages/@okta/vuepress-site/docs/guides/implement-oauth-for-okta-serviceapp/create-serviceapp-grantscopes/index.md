title: Create a service app and grant scopes
---

Create an OAuth service app and register the public key with the service app using the dynamic client registration endpoint (`/oauth/v1/clients`). Then grant the scopes that you want to allow for the service app.

## Create a service app

1. Use the following POST example to create your service app using the `/oauth2/v1/clients` endpoint and provide values for these parameters:

    * `client_name` &mdash; Name of the service app
    * `grant_types` &mdash; `client_credentials`
    * `token_endpoint_auth_method` &mdash; `private_key_jwt`
    * `application_type` &mdash; `service`
    * `jwks` &mdash; Add the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) that you created in the <GuideLink link="../create-publicprivate-keypair">last step</GuideLink>.

```JSON
    curl -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d ' {
        "client_name": "Service Client Name",
        "response_types": [
          "token"
        ],
        "grant_types": [
          "client_credentials"
       ],
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt",
        "application_type": "service",
        "jwks": {
              "keys": [
                     {
                       "kty": "RSA",
                       "e": "AQAB",
                       "use": "sig",
                       "kid": "O4O",
                       "alg": "RS256",
                       "n": "u0VYW2-76A_lYg5NQihhcPJYYU9-NHbNaO6LFERWnOUbU7l3MJdmCailwSzjO76O-2GdLE-Hn2kx04jWCCPofnQ8xNmFScNo8UQ1dKVq0UkFK-sl-Z0Uu19GiZa2fxSWwg_1g2t-ZpNtKCI279xGBi_hTnupqciUonWe6CIvTv0FfX0LiMqQqjARxPS-6fdBZq8WN9qLGDwpjHK81CoYuzASOezVFYDDyXYzV0X3X_kFVt2sqL5DVN684bEbTsWl91vV-bGmswrlQ0UVUq6t78VdgMrj0RZBD-lFNJcY7CwyugpgLbnm4HEJmCOWJOdjVLj3hFxVVblNJQQ1Z15UXw"
                       }
                     ]
           }
    }' "https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/clients"
```

2. Make note of the `client_id` that is returned in the response. You need that to grant scopes to your service app and when you create and sign the JWT.

### Grant allowed scopes

When a request is sent to the Okta Org Authorization Server's `/token` endpoint, it validates all of the requested scopes in the request against the service app's grants collection. The scope is granted if the scope exists in the service app's grants collection.

> **Note:** You can find a list of available values for `scopeId` on the [Scopes and supported endpoints](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/scopes/) page.

Now that you've created the service app and registered the public key with that service app, you need to define the allowed scopes.

> **Note:** Only the Super Admin role has permissions to grant scopes to an app.

1. Use the `/grants` API to add a grant for an allowed scope to your service app. The POST example request below creates a grant for the `okta.users.read` scope.

2. Provide values for these parameters in your request:

    * `scopeID` &mdash; `okta.users.read`
    * `issuer` &mdash; `https://{yourOktaDomain}`

```JSON
  curl -X POST \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "scopeId": "okta.users.read",
      "issuer": "https://{yourOktaDomain}"
  }' "https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/apps/{serviceappclient_id}/grants"
```

> **Note:** You can also use the Developer Console to grant allowed scopes to your service app on the **Okta API Scopes** tab. Click **Grant** for each of the scopes that you want to add to the application's grant collection.
