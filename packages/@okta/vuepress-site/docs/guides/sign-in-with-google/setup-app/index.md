1.1. Go to <https://console.developers.google.com/> and register for a developer account if you haven't already done so.

1.2. Create a Google API Console project. Instructions for creating a project can be found here: <https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project>. You can leave the "Authorized redirect URIs" section blank for now, you will return to it later.

1.3. Save the OAuth client ID and secret values so you can add them to the Okta configuration in the next section.
