The Identity Engine SDK included with the Classic Engine Authentication SDK does not have a new method for basic sign out. See the previous sign-out method ([signOut](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/tree/2bae66c5f56998d7b71b8f04fe1474d6eae85868#signout)) for implementation details for both Classic Engine and Identity Engine.
