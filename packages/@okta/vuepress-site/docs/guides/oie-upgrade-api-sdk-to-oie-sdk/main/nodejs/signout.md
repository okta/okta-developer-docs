The Identity Engine SDK included with the Classic Engine Authentication SDK does not have a new method for basic sign out. See the previous sign-out method ([signOut](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/tree/master#signout)) for implementation details for both Classic Engine and Identity Engine.

See also [User sign out (local app)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-out/nodejs/main/).
