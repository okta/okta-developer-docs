After you complete a basic-sign flow React app with a custom sign-in experience using the SDK, you can extend your app's sign-in experience by adding features such as multifactor or social IdP authentication.

For further details on using the SDK to implement these features, see the [Okta Auth JS SDK Interaction Code reference](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/blob/master/docs/idx.md#usage).

To set up your Okta org for these use cases, see:

* See [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case)
* See [Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case)
* See [Sign in with Facebook using the Widget](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-sign-in-soc-idp/) for an example of a web application that uses the Sign-In Widget with social IdP authentication.

> **Note**: Identity Engine org configuration is supported by the Admin Console and by the Okta API.
