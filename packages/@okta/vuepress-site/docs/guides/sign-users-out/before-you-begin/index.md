This guide shows you how to sign users out of your app and out of Okta.

If you are building a web app that is served by a server framework, see [Sign users in to your web application](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/). If you are building a mobile app, see [Sign users in to your mobile app](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/).

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. (Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).)
* Already followed one of our sign-in guides: 
    * [Sign users in to your web app](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/) 
    * [Sign users in to your single-page app](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/)
    * [Sign users in to your mobile app](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/)
