This guide shows you how to sign users out of your app and out of Okta.

<!-- If you are building a web app that is served by a server framework, see [Sign Users in to Your Web App]. If you are building a mobile app, see [Sign Users in to Your Mobile App]. -->

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. (Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).)
* Already followed one of our sign-in guides: 
    * [Sign Users in to Your Web App](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/) 
    * [Sign Users in to Your Single-Page App](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/)
