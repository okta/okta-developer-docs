Clear the user's tokens by calling:

```javascript
import { clearTokens } from '@okta/okta-react-native';

clearTokens()
    .then(() => { })
    .catch(e => { });
```

#### Revoke tokens (optional)

Calling `clearTokens()` discards tokens from the local device storage, but theyâ€™re technically still active until they expire. An optional step is to revoke the tokens so they can't be used, even by accident. You can revoke tokens using the following requests:

```javascript
await revokeAccessToken();
```

This revokes the access token to make it inactive. Resolves `true` if the access token has been successfully revoked.

```javascript
await revokeIdToken();
```

This revokes the ID token to make it inactive. Resolves `true` if the ID token has been successfully revoked.

```javascript
await revokeRefreshToken();
```

This revokes the refresh token to make it inactive. Resolves `true` if the refresh token has been successfully revoked.

Access, ID, and refresh tokens must be revoked in separate requests.
