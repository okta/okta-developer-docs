OClient -> idp: Makes SAML request to the IdP
idp -> OClient: Sends SAML 2.0 Assertion in response
OClient -> okta: Sends Base64-encoded SAML 2.0 Assertion to /token
okta -> OClient: Verifies assertion and sends access token (optionally ID token, refresh token)
OClient -> rs: Makes a resource request with the access token to the resource server

At a high level, the SAML 2.0 Assertion flow has the following steps:

1. The client app makes a SAML request to the Identity Provider.
2. Identity Provider responds to the client app with a SAML 2.0 assertion.
3. The client app sends the Base64-encoded SAML 2.0 assertion in a request to the Okta authorization server to exchange the assertion for a token(s).
4. The Okta authorization server verifies the assertion and responds with the access token (optionally ID token, refresh token).
5. The client app makes a request with the access token to the resource server.
