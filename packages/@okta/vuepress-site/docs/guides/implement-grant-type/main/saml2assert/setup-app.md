5. Select **Native Application** for **Application type**, then click **Next**.
1. Enter an **App integration name**.
1. Select **Refresh Token** in the **Grant type** section, and then click **Advanced** and select **SAML 2.0 Assertion**. These selections enable you to exchange an assertion for the access token and also request a refresh token.
   > **Note:** If you're using Okta Classic Engine, select **Refresh Token** and **SAML 2.0 Assertion** in the **Grant type** section.
1. Enter the callback location in the **Sign-in redirect URIs** box. This is where Okta returns the browser (along with the token).
1. Fill in the remaining details for your app integration, then click **Save**.
1. Locate the **General Settings** section on the **General** tab, and then click **Edit**.


   > **Note:** The refresh token lifetime depends on the assertion lifetime and the [API Access Management policies](#configure-the-authorization-server-policy). The assertion lifetime is based on the incoming assertion. The lowest of these defined values is the refresh token max lifetime. For example, the SAML assertion expiry is set to 30 days, and the refresh token expiry in your access policies is set to 180 days. This results in a refresh token lifetime of 30 days.

1. Click **Save**.

Save the generated **Client ID** and **Client secret** values to implement your authorization flow.

> **Note:** You can either create an OIDC app integration or use an existing one. In the previous instructions, you're creating a native (mobile) app integration using the Admin Console. Use the [Dynamic Client Registration API](/docs/reference/api/oauth-clients/#client-application-object) to create a SPA or web client application for use with the SAML 2.0 Assertion grant type.

### Configure the authorization server policy

Make sure that the SAML 2.0 Assertion grant type is enabled in the authorization server. You can create a rule or update an existing one. In this example, you're updating the default policy rule.

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Security** > **API**.
1. On the **Authorization Servers** tab, select **default** from the **Name** column in the table. In this example, you're configuring the default policy rule for the [default custom authorization server](/docs/concepts/auth-servers/).

    > **Note:** See [Configure an access policy](/docs/guides/configure-access-policy/) for information on creating an access policy in the Okta authorization server.

1. Select the **Access Policies** tab and then click the pencil for the default policy rule to access the **Edit Rule** dialog.
1. Click **Advanced** in the **IF Grant type is** section, and then select **SAML 2.0 Assertion**.

> **Note:** If you're using Classic Engine, select **SAML 2.0 Assertion** in the **IF Grant type is** section.

1. Click **Update Rule**.
