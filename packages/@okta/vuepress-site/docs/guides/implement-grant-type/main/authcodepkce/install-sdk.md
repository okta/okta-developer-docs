## Use an SDK

Okta recommends using existing libraries and OAuth 2.0 helper methods to implement your authentication flow. You can also use one of the Okta SDKs. If an appropriate Okta SDK isn't available, another option is using an open-source library.

> **Note:** See [Languages & SDKs overview](/code/) for a list of Okta SDKs you can download to start using with your app.

For instructions on how to install and use Okta SDKs, refer to [Configure the SDK](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/main/#configure-your-app) for front-end SDKs. Refer to [Add packages](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app-redirect/main/#add-packages) for mobile SDKs. You can download Okta sample apps to see how the SDKs are used in your app's framework. See [Examples](#examples) for a list of sample apps.
