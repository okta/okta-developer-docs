 At a high level, the flow has the following steps:

1. Your application (app) generates a code verifier followed by a code challenge. See [Create the proof key for code exchange](#create-the-proof-key-for-code-exchange).
2. Your app requests an authorization code from the authorization server (Okta). The request contains the generated code challenge.

   Before implementing this redirect request to the authorization server, you need to [set up your app](#set-up-your-app) in Okta. See [Request an authorization code](#request-an-authorization-code).

3. Okta presents an authentication prompt (the Okta sign-in page) to the user's browser.
4. The user authenticates with the authorization server and provides consent.

    For Okta to authenticate the user credentials, Okta needs user profile data.
    See [Add a user using the Admin Console](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-usgp-add-users), [Import Users](/docs/guides/password-import-inline-hook/), and the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/). Alternatively, you can [set up self-service registration](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-self-reg/) to allow users to register their membership with the app.

5. Okta redirects back to your application with an authorization code.
6. Your application sends this code, along with the code verifier, to Okta. See [Exchange the code for tokens](#exchange-the-code-for-tokens).
7. Okta evaluates the PKCE code.
8. Okta returns access and ID tokens, and optionally a refresh token.
9. Your application can now use these tokens to call the resource server (for example, an API) on behalf of the user.
10. The resource server validates the token before responding to the request. See [Validate access token](#validate-access-token).
