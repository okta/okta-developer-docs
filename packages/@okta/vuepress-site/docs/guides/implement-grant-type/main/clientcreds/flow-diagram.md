At a high level, this flow has the following steps:

1. Your client application (app) makes an authorization request to your Okta authorization server using its client credentials.

    Before implementing this redirect request to the authorization server (Okta), you need to [set up your app](#set-up-your-app) in Okta. See [Request for token](#request-for-token).

1. Okta responds with an access token if the request credentials are accurate.
1. Your app uses the access token to make authorized requests to the resource server.
1. The resource server validates the token before responding to the request. See [Validate access token](#validate-access-token).
