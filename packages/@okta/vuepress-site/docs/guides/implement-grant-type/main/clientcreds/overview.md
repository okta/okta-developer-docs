## About the Client Credentials grant

Use the Client Credentials flow for server-side ("confidential") client applications with no end user. Typically, that means for machine-to-machine communication. In this scenario, your application needs to store its client ID and secret securely and to exchange them with Okta for an access token.

See the [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect decision flowchart](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#choosing-an-oauth-2-0-flow) for the appropriate flow recommended for your app.
