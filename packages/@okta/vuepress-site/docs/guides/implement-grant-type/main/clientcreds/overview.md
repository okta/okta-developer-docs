## About the Client Credentials grant

The Client Credentials flow is recommended for server-side ("confidential") client applications with no end user, which normally describes machine-to-machine communication. Your application needs to securely store its Client ID and secret and pass those to Okta in exchange for an access token.

See the [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect decision flowchart](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#choosing-an-oauth-2-0-flow) for the appropriate flow recommended for your app.
