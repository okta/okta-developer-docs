If you are building a Single-Page Application (SPA) on browsers that don't support Web Crypto for PKCE, then the Implicit flow is the recommended method for controlling access between your SPA and a resource server. The Implicit flow is intended for applications where the confidentiality of the client secret can't be guaranteed. In this flow, the client doesn't make a request to the `/token` endpoint, but instead receives the access token directly from the `/authorize` endpoint. The client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user agent and capable of receiving incoming requests (through redirection) from the Authorization Server.

See [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect overview](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#implicit-flow) for OAuth 2.0 and Implicit flow concepts.

> **Note:** For SPAs running in modern browsers that support Web Crypto for PKCE, we recommend using the [Authorization Code flow with PKCE](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main) instead for maximum security.
