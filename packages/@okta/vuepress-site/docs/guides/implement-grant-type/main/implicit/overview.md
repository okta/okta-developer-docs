The Implicit flow is deprecated and not a recommended approach. Okta recommends you use the <GuideLink link="../../authcodepkce/main/">Authorization Code flow with PKCE</GuideLink> instead. To select the appropriate flow to use for your application, see [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect overview](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#choosing-an-oauth-2-0-flow)'s decision flowchart.

If you are building a Single-Page Application (SPA) on browsers that don't support Web Crypto for PKCE, then the Implicit flow can be used for controlling access between your SPA and a resource server. The Implicit flow is intended for applications where the confidentiality of the client secret can't be guaranteed. In this flow, the client doesn't make a request to the `/token` endpoint, but instead receives the access token directly from the `/authorize` endpoint. The client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user agent and capable of receiving incoming requests (through redirection) from the authorization server.
