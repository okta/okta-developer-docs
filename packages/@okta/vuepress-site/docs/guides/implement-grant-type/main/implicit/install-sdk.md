## Use an SDK

Okta recommends using existing libraries and OAuth 2.0 helper methods to implement your authentication flow. You can use one of Okta's SDKs or an open-source library if an appropriate Okta SDK isn't available. See [Languages & SDKs overview](/code/) for a list of Okta SDKs that you can download to start using with your app.
