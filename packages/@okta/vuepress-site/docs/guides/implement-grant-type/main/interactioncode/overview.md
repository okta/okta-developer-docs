## About the Interaction Code grant

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

The Interaction Code grant type is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard extension that is available in the Identity Engine to manage user interactions. The Interaction Code grant is typically used by native, SPA, and web client apps that want to interact directly with the user and mediate between the user and the authorization server, instead of using a [browser-based redirect](/docs/concepts/redirect-vs-embedded/) to hand off the authentication experience.

See [Interaction Code grant type](/docs/concepts/interaction-code) for more information.
