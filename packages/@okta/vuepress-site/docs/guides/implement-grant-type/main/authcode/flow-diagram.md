At a high level, this flow has the following steps:

1. Your application (app) directs the browser to the Okta sign-in page.

    Before implementing this redirect request to the authorization server (Okta), you need to [set up your app](#set-up-your-app) in Okta. See [Request an authorization code](#request-an-authorization-code).

2. Okta redirects the user's browser to an authentication prompt (the Okta sign-in page).
3. The user authenticates.

    For Okta to authenticate the user credentials, Okta needs user profile data.
    See [Add a user using Console](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-usgp-add-users), [Import Users](/docs/guides/password-import-inline-hook/), and the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/). Alternatively, you can [set up self-service registration](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-self-reg/) to allow users to register their membership with the app.

4. The browser receives an authorization code from the authorization server (Okta) after the user is authenticated. The authorization code is passed to your app.
5. Your app sends this code and the client secret to Okta. See [Exchange the code for tokens](#exchange-the-code-for-tokens).
6. Okta returns access and ID tokens, and optionally a refresh token.
7. Your app can now use these tokens to call the resource server (for example an API) on behalf of the user.
8. The resource server validates the token before responding to the request. See [Validate access token](#validate-access-token).
