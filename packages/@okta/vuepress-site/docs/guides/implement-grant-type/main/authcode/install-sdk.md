## Use an SDK

Okta recommends using existing libraries and OAuth 2.0 helper methods to implement your authentication flow. You can use one of the Okta SDKs or an open-source library if an appropriate Okta SDK isn’t available. See [Recommended Okta SDKs](/code/) for a list of Okta SDKs that you can download to start using with your app.

Refer to [Configure your app](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app-redirect/main/#configure-your-app) for instructions on how to install and use Okta back-end framework SDKs. You can download Okta sample apps to see how the SDKs are used in your app's framework. See [Examples](#examples) for a list of sample apps.
