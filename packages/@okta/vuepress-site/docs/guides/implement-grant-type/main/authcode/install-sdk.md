## Use an SDK

Okta recommends using existing libraries and OAuth 2.0 helper methods to implement your authentication flow. You can use one of Okta's many language and framework SDKs or an open-source library if an appropriate Okta SDK is not available. See [Languages & SDKs overview](/code/) for a list of Okta SDKs that you can download to start using with your app.

Refer to [Add and configure packages](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/configure-packages) for instructions on how to install and use Okta back-end framework SDKs. You can download Okta sample apps to see how the SDKs are used in your app's framework. See [Examples](#examples) for a list of sample apps.
