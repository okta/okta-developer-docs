## About the Authorization Code grant

If you are building a server-side (or web) application that is capable of securely storing secrets, then the Authorization Code flow is the recommended method for controlling access to it.

See the [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect decision flowchart](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#choosing-an-oauth-2-0-flow) for flow recommendations.
