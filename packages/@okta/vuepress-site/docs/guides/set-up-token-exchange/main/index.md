## Overview

OAuth 2.0 solves the problem of delegated access to resources across services mediated by an authorization server. For example, a user delegates permission to a social networking mobile app to manage their profile and run background processes on behalf of the user, like reminding the user about upcoming events.

However, with the adoption of microservices, a resource server must sometimes access resources hosted by other downstream services on behalf of the user to satisfy a client request. Traditionally these API calls are made as machine-to-machine requests that use an access token obtained using the Client Credentials grant type. But, the user context is lost while making these machine-to-machine requests.

[OAuth On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693) helps retain the user context in requests to downstream services. It provides a protocol approach to support scenarios where a client can exchange an access token received from an upstream client for a new token by interacting with the authorization server.

## Token Exchange Flow

<div class="three-quarter">

![Flow diagram that displays the back and forth between the client, resources, and the authorization server](/img/auth/on-behalf-of-token-exchange-flow.png)

</div>

> **Note:** This flow assumes that user authentication and authorization are complete and the authorization server issued an access token and ID token.

1. The user is successfully signed in to a mobile app and makes a request.
1. The mobile app makes a request to the API1 service and includes the user’s valid access token.
1. API1 needs to communicate with API2 to further process the user request. The API1 service makes a request to the Okta authorization server to exchange the user’s access token for a new token.
1. The authorization server validates the user’s access token, and then grants a new access token to API1 with scopes that allow API1 to make requests to API2. The new access token retains the user context so the API2 service knows on whose behalf the request is made.
1. The API1 service makes a request to the API2 service and includes the new access token.

> **Note:** You can determine which API service made API calls on behalf of which user by analyzing the token grant events in the [Okta System Log](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/).

## Set up token exchange

The following sections explain the setup for an example token exchange flow using a single custom authorization server. For an example token exchange flow using more than one authorization server within an Okta tenant, see the [Trusted servers](#trusted-servers) section.

### Create a native app integration

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Applications** > **Applications**.
1. Click **Create App Integration**.
1. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect**, and then **Native Application**.
1. Name your application and at the bottom of the page select **Allow everyone in your organization to access**.
1. Click **Save** and at the top of the page click **Back to Applications**.

> **Note:** Okta recommends that native apps use the Authorization Code with PKCE authentication flow. See [Implement authorization by grant type](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/#create-the-proof-key-for-code-exchange) for more information on creating the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for your native app.

### Create a service app

In token exchange use cases, an API microservice can act both as a resource server and a client. For this example, the native app gets an access token to make API requests to API1. API1 acts as the resource server. When API1 needs to talk to API2 on behalf of the user, API1 becomes the OAuth client. Create a service app that represents API1.

1. On the **Applications** page, click **Create App Integration**.
1. Select **API Services**, and then click **Next**.
1. Name your application. For this example, enter **API1**, and then click **Save**.
1. In the **General Settings** section of the **General** tab, click **Edit** and select **Token Exchange** as the grant type for your application.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Copy the client ID in the **Client Credentials** section, and then copy the client secret in the **CLIENT SECRETS** section.
1. [Base64 encode](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#base64-encode-the-client-id-and-client-secret) the client ID and client secret for use in the token exchange request from API1 to API2.

### Update the authorization servers

The following sections explain how to update the authorization servers for this example.

#### Create custom scopes

Add some custom scopes to both authorization servers to request during the token exchange calls.

> **Note:** You can't include the `offline_access` scope or any of the OpenID Connect scopes when using a service app. This means that you can't request refresh tokens or ID tokens in a service app-initiated token exchange flow.

1. From the Admin Console, select **Security** > **API**, and then select one of the authorization servers that you want to use.
1. Select the **Scopes** tab, and then click **Add Scope**.
1. In the dialog that appears, enter a scope name: **api:access:read**.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Repeat steps 1 through 4 and create a second custom scope called **api:access:write**.
1. Repeat steps 1 through 5 for the second authorization server.

#### Create access policies and rules

An [access policy](/docs/guides/configure-access-policy/main/) helps you secure your APIs by defining different access token lifetimes for a given combination of grant type, user, and scope. Create policy rules to determine if an app is permitted to access specific information from your protected APIs and for how long. Access policies are specific to an authorization server, client apps that you designate for the policy, and the API resource that you want to mint tokens for.

1. From the **API** page, click edit for the authorization server that you want to use for the initial authentication.
1. Select the **Access Policies** tab, and then click **Add New Access Policy** to add a policy that allows the native app to access API1.
1. In the **Add Policy** dialog that appears, enter the following:

   * **Name:** Enter **Access API1**.
   * **Description:** Enter a description.
   * **Assign to:** Select **The following clients**, start typing the name of the native app that you created earlier, and select it from the list that appears.

1. Click **Create Policy**.
1. Click **Add Rule** and in the dialog that appears, enter the following:

   * **Name:** Enter **Mobile app to API1**.
   * **AND Scopes requested:** Select **The following scopes** and enter **openid**.

1. Click **Create rule**.
1. Repeat steps 1 through 6 to create a policy and a rule that allows the service app that represents API1 to talk to API2. Use the following values for the policy:

   * **Name:** Enter **Access API2**.
   * **Assign to:** Select **The following clients**, start typing **API1** (the service app that you created earlier) and select it from the list that appears.

   Use the following values for the rule:
   * **Name:** Enter **API1 to API2**.
   * **AND Scopes requested:** Select **The following scopes**, start typing **api:access:read**, and select it from the list that appears. Repeat for **api:access:write** and select it from the list.

## Flow specifics

### Authorization Code with PKCE request

Use the Authorization Code with PKCE flow to obtain an authorization code for the client. In this case, the mobile app requests tokens so that it can talk to API1.

```cURL
curl --location --request POST \
  --url 'https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/{authServerId}/v1/authorize' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'client_id=${nativeAppClientId}' \
  --data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=${configuredRedirectUri}' \
  --data-urlencode 'response_type=code' \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=openid' \
  --data-urlencode 'state=testState' \
  --data-urlencode 'code_challenge_method=S256' \
  --data-urlencode 'code_challenge=${code_challenge}' \
```

**Response**

```bash
https://${configuredRedirectUri}/?code=FQGFlDO-J1jXl....7-cfYJ0KtKB8&state=testState`
```

### Exchange code for tokens request

```curl
curl --location --request POST \
  --url 'https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/{authServerId}/v1/token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
  --data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=${configuredRedirectUri}' \
  --data-urlencode 'code=FQGFlDO-J1j.....QvabuZ7-cfYJ0KtKB8' \
  --data-urlencode 'code_verifier=xO5wgOEH5UA2XUdVQ88pM.....Rtc5ERKq1MeonMo8QLCSRYlDk' \
  --data-urlencode 'client_id=${nativeAppClientId}'
```

**Response**

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJ6………X1Z4QA",
    "scope": "openid"
}
```

### Token exchange request from service app to API

> **Note:** Include the Base64-encoded client ID and secret within the Authorization header. See the following example for the format.

```curl
curl --location --request POST \
  --url 'https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic {Base64 encoded service app client ID and client secret}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange' \
  --data-urlencode 'subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token' \
  --data-urlencode 'subject_token={access token from the Authorization Code with PKCE flow}' \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=api:access:read api:access:write' \
  --data-urlencode 'audience=com.api.atko' \
```

Properties sent in the request body:

* `grant_type`: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
* `subject_token_type`: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
* `subject_token`: the access token from the Authorization Code with PKCE flow
* `scope`: the scopes required for API1 to talk to API2.
* `audience`: audience of the authorization server

**Response**

```json
{
    {
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJBVj.....bsW6C8Qg",
    "scope": "api:access:read api:access:write",
    "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"
     }
}
```

**Access token decoded**

To check the returned access token payload, you can copy the value and paste it into any JWT decoder (for example: https://jwt.io/). Then, verify that the scope claim (`scp`) and the audience claim (`aud`) are correct. The audience should match the custom authorization server audience.

```json
{
  "ver": 1,
  "jti": "AT.nmEEZjEgPk62Us10J5aG4kUfg7DWoLIExSotYJA-rJ4",
  "iss": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default",
  "aud": "com.api.atko",
  "iat": 1675220791,
  "exp": 1675224391,
  "cid": "0oa9aw62CPUnXomeU9c5",
  "uid": "00u930ooYXgBltqbs9c5",
  "scp": [
    "api:access:read",
    "api:access:write"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1675220791,
  "sub": "user@example.com"
}
```

## Trusted servers

You can perform token exchange within a single authorization server or between other authorization servers under the same Okta tenant. The previous example discussed a token exchange within a single custom authorization server. To perform token exchange between authorization servers within the same tenant, make the authorization server that issued the subject token trusted under the authorization server against which the token exchange request is made.

A trusted server handles authenticated requests after the application obtains an access token. The incoming subject token (access token) is used to evaluate a subject.

The following sections explain how to set up a trusted server, access policy, and rule. Then, you can make the token exchange request with the trusted server.

### Add a trusted server

Add the authorization server that you used in the previous flow as a trusted server of the authorization server that handles the token exchange in the this flow.

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Security** > **API**.
1. Select edit on the right of the authorization server that you plan to use in the token exchange flow.
1. In the **Trusted servers** section, click **Add Server**.
1. In the **Search** box, enter the name of the authorization server that you used in the previous token exchange flow. Matching results appear in a list. If more than 20 results appear, you can click **Show more**.
1. Click **Add** beside the authorization server, and then click **Done**. The authorization server appears in the **Trusted servers** section.

### Create an access policy and rule

Create an access policy and rule so that the service app can access API2 using a different authorization server than the one that granted the original access token for the user.

1. Select the **Access Policies** tab, and then click **Add New Access Policy** to add a policy that allows the service app to access API2.
1. In the **Add Policy** dialog, do the following:

   * **Name:** Enter **Access API2**.
   * **Description:** Enter a description.
   * **Assign to:** Select **The following clients**, start typing **API1**, and then select it from the list that appears.

1. Click **Create Policy**.
1. Click **Add Rule** and in the dialog, do the following:

   * **Name:** Enter **API1 to API2**.
   * **AND Scopes requested:** Select **The following scopes**, start typing **api:access:read**, and select it from the list that appears. Repeat for **api:access:write** and select it from the list.

1. Click **Create rule**.

### Flow specifics with a trusted server

Perform the requests in the previous [Flow specifics](#flow-specifics) section. When you reach the [token exchange request from the service app](#token-exchange-request-from-service-app-to-api) request, it should look like the following:

> **Note:** Include the Base64-encoded client ID and secret within the Authorization header. See the following example for the format.

```curl
curl --location --request POST \
  --url 'https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/{trustedAuthServerId}/v1/token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic {Base64 encoded service app client ID and client secret}' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange' \
  --data-urlencode 'subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token' \
  --data-urlencode 'subject_token={access token from the Authorization Code with PKCE flow}' \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=api:access:read api:access:write' \
  --data-urlencode 'audience=com.api.atko' \
```

This request is sent to the authorization server with the trusted server that you configured in the [Add a trusted server](#add-a-trusted-server) section.

Properties sent in the request body:

* `grant_type`: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
* `subject_token_type`: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
* `subject_token`: access token from the Authorization Code with PKCE flow
* `scope`: the scopes required for API1 to talk to API2
* `audience`: the audience of the authorization server that trusts the other authorization server

**Response**

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJR.....ajXZIk3GryDPC8OIhLsQ",
    "scope": "api:access:read api:access:write",
    "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"
}
```

**Access token decoded**

The decoded access token shows the audience of the authorization server, the requested scopes, and the original user as the value of the `sub` parameter.

```json
{
  "ver": 1,
  "jti": "AT.cW5tnqgEKrm2Us9t2W3YXWOz1HYc3JOmA4aPYkthJJM",
  "iss": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/aus9awb5qgcRPB2Ey9c5",
  "aud": "com.api.atko",
  "iat": 1675287544,
  "exp": 1675291144,
  "cid": "0oa9aw62CPUnXomeU9c5",
  "uid": "00u930ooYXgBltqbs9c5",
  "scp": [
    "api:access:read",
    "api:access:write"
  ],
  "auth_time": 1675287544,
  "sub": "user@example.com"
}
```
