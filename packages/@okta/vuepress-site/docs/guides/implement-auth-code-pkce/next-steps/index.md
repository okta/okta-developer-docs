When your application passes a request with an `access_token`, the resource server will need to validate it. For more on this, see [Validate Access Tokens](/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/).

### Examples

The following native application examples show the authorization code flow, as it would be implemented by a native application that needs to authenticate a user.  These are complete example applications that show the entire experience.
