This use case requires the **password** and **email** factors.

## Configuration updates

Before you build a password recovery flow with an email factor, ensure that your org is configured for a multifactor use case by completing the steps in [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case).

### Set email as the only factor enabled for password recovery

In addition to configuring your Okta org for the multifactor use case, you need to enable email as the only factor for password recovery.

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Security** > **Authenticators**.
1. On the **Authenticators** page, click **Actions** and then **Edit** for the **Password** authenticator.
1. In the **Password** page, scroll down to the bottom of the page for the **Default Policy** and click
   the edit pencil icon for the **Default Rule**.
1. In the **Edit Rule** dialog box, ensure that the following values are configured for the **AND Users can initiate recovery with** field:
   * **Phone (SMS / Voice call)**: Clear
   * **Email**: Selected
1. Click **Update Rule** if you change any values.
