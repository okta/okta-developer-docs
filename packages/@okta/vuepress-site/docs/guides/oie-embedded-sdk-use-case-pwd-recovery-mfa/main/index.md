This use case describes how to integrate a password recovery flow into your app using the SDK. The flow includes an email factor step that the user needs to verify before updating their password.

## Factor setup

This use case requires the **password** and **email** factors.

## Configuration updates

Before you build a password recovery flow with an email factor, you need to complete the following configuration:

### Step 1:  Set up your Okta org for a password factor

Ensure your org is configured for the password factor by completing the steps in [Set up your Okta org for password factor only use cases](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-password-factor-only-use-cases).

### Step 2:  Set up your Okta org for multifactor use cases

Ensure your org is configured for a multifactor use case by completing the steps in [Set up your Okta org for multi-factor use cases](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-multifactor-use-cases).

> **Note:** Ensure your app integration is configured to use **Password + Another factor** in the app integration's **Sign On Policy** rule section.

### Step 3:  Set email as the only factor enabled for password recovery

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Security** > **Authenticators**.
1. On the **Authenticators** page, click **Actions** and then **Edit** for the **Password** authenticator.
1. In the **Password** page, scroll down to the bottom of the page for the **Default Policy** and click
   the edit pencil icon for the **Default Rule**.
1. In the **Edit Rule** dialog box, ensure that the following values are configured for the **AND Users can initiate recovery with** field:
   * **Phone (SMS / Voice call)**: Clear
   * **Email**: Selected
1. Click **Update Rule** if you change any values.
