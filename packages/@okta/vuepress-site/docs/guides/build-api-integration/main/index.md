## Overview

A service-to-service app where a backend service or a daemon calls [Okta management APIs](/docs/reference/core-okta-api/) for a tenant (Okta org) can be published in the Okta Integration Network (OIN) as an API service integration.
API service integrations access Okta APIs using the OAuth 2.0 [Client Credentials flow](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#client-credentials-flow), where access isn't associated with a user and you can restrict resources with scoped access tokens. Each access token enables the bearer to perform specific actions on specific Okta endpoints, with that ability controlled by which scopes the access token contains.

> **Note:** Currently, Okta only supports the OAuth APIs listed in [Scopes and supported endpoints](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/#scopes-and-supported-endpoints).

Customers can use any API service integration listed in the OIN catalog with their Okta tenant org. Each customer Okta org has its own authorization server that supports the Client Credentials flow. When a customer authorizes your API service integration to access their org, Okta generates a unique set of credentials (client ID and client secret) for that org.
You must collect and [store these credentials](#save-customer-credentials) for each customer to allow your integration to work with your customer's Okta org.

### API service integration Client Credentials flow

At a high level, the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow for an API service integration has the following steps:

-->

1. Your customer's service app instance makes an access token request to their Okta Authorization Server using their client credentials.

   Your customer needs to install and authorize your integration in their Okta org so that Okta can accept the access token request. See [Add an API Service Integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-api-service-integration) for customer tenant Admin Console instructions. After installing your integration, the customer obtains their client credentials and passes them to your app. The customer's app instance can now make an access token request to Okta. See [Request for access token](#request-an-access-token).

2. If the credentials in the token request are accurate, Okta responds with an access token.

   You set the resource and action scopes allowed for the access token when you [register your API service integration](#register-your-api-service-integration) through the OIN Manager. The token request must contain allowed scopes for your API service integration. See [Scope selection](#scope-selection).

3. Your customer's service app instance uses the access token to make authorized requests to their Okta org APIs (the resource server). See [Make Okta API requests](#make-okta-api-requests).

4. The customer's Okta org (resource server) validates the token before responding to the API request.

## Build your API service integration

This section outlines the components, artifacts, and requests required to build your API service integration using basic cURL commands. You can use an OAuth 2.0 library in your preferred language to implement the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow.

> **Note:** For an example of how to implement the Client Credentials flow using Spring Boot, see [How to use Client Credentials flow with Spring Security](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/05/05/client-credentials-spring-security). This example uses the [Okta Spring Boot Starter](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot) library. You can ignore the custom scopes and authorization server parts of the example since they don't apply to the API service integration use case.

### Save customer credentials

Okta generates a unique set of credentials (client ID and client secret) for your customer when they install your integration in their Okta org. See [Add an API Service Integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-api-service-integration).

You must store these credentials for each customer to allow your integration to work with the customer's Okta org. To implement the Client Credentials flow in your integration, provide an interface to collect and store these API service integration credentials:

* Okta tenant (organization) domain (for example, `acme.okta.com`)
* client ID
* client secret

> **Note:** This guide refers to these values as `${customerOktaDomain}`, `${clientId}`, and `${clientSecret}` variables.

### Scope selection

You must specify the resources and actions that your API service app requires to do its job. A scope corresponds to a resource you want to access in the Okta API (users, logs, and so on) and a level of access (read or manage). Use the least-privilege principle and authorize the fewest scopes needed for your app to function correctly. See the list of available Okta [Scopes and supported endpoints](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/#scopes-and-supported-endpoints).

There are two types of scope: read and manage. Read scopes can only view resources, while manage scopes can read, create, update, and delete resources. You don't need to request a read scope when you request a manage scope because manage scopes already include read access.

| Action    | Read scopes           | Manage scopes   |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Read | Yes | Yes |
| Create | No | Yes |
| Update | No | Yes |
| Delete | No | Yes |

The [Okta Org Authorization Server](/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#org-authorization-server) returns all the scopes that you request if you registered those scopes along with your integration. Currently, API service integrations don't support optional scopes. You can request a subset of your integration-supported scopes when requesting an access token from the `/token` endpoint. For example, if you registered the `okta.users.manage`, `okta.groups.manage`, and `okta.apps.manage` scopes for your integration, but your service only needs to retrieve and update Okta groups for a specific task, then you can specify only the `okta.groups.manage` scope in your access token request.

### Register your API service integration

The OIN Manager provides a mechanism to register and install your integration in your Okta org (similar to how your customer admins would install your integration) and obtain the credentials to test your Client Credentials flow. Your test integration is available only on your Okta org during the test.

> **Note:** The test install and authorize pages, from the OIN Manager test option, are the same pages your customers experience when your service integration is in the OIN. After you publish your integration in the OIN catalog, it appears in the **Applications** > **API Service Integrations** page of your customer's Admin Console.

To register your API service registration:

1. Navigate to the [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com/) and click **Start Submission Form**.
1. Sign in with the credentials of the Okta org you used to build your integration (this is typically your developer-edition Okta org).
1. Click **Add New Submission**.
1. On the **General Settings** tab, specify values in the **App Information**, **Customer Support**, and **Test Account** sections. See [Configure general settings](/docs/guides/submit-app/openidconnect/main/#configure-general-settings) for field descriptions.
1. On the **API Service** tab, select **On** from the **API Service support** dropdown menu.

   The **API Service Settings** appear, and the **Client Credentials** grant type is selected. This is the only supported grant type for OAuth 2.0 API service integrations.
1. Under **Enable scopes**, click **+ Add Another** to specify a scope for your app integration.

   * Enter the Okta API scope to grant access from your integration. See [Scope selection](#scope-selection).
   * Click **+ Add Another** and specify additional scopes you want to grant for your integration.

1. Specify the URL to the configuration document for your integration under **Link to configuration guide**. See [Customer configuration document guidelines](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#customer-configuration-document-guidelines).

### Authorize a test integration

Use the test functionality in the OIN Manager to obtain test integration credentials:

1. From the [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com/), click **Edit** next to your API service integration submission.
1. From the **API Service** tab, click **Test in Okta** at the bottom of your page.

   Your browser redirects to the Authorize integration page in your Okta org.

1. From the Authorize integration page, click **Install and Authorize**.
1. Copy the client secret from the dialog and securely store it for your integration test.
1. Click **Done** to dismiss the dialog.
1. On the integration details page, copy the Okta domain and client ID and securely store them for your integration test.

For testing purposes, use the Okta domain, client ID, and client secret obtained from your test integration to make an access token request. Then, make an API request using the access token returned by the first request. See [Test your API service flow](#test-your-api-service-flow).

### Request an access token

Your service app integration needs to request an access token to access the Okta APIs securely. Use the following configuration variables to form the access token request:

* `${customerOktaDomain}`: Your customer tenant Okta org domain
* `${clientId}`: Your customer's integration client ID
* `${clientSecret}`: Your customer's integration client secret
* `${scopes}`: The resource scopes required for the access token

> **Note:** If you're using an OAuth 2.0 library, you typically need to configure an OAuth client class with a `tokenUri` parameter, as well as the `clientId` and `clientSecret` parameters. Specify the `tokenUri` string as `https://${customerOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/token`.

Follow these steps to use a Basic Authorization header in a `/token` request:

1. Base64-encode the string and set it in the Authorization header:

   ```sh
   Authorization: Basic ${Base64(${clientId}:${clientSecret})}
   ```

1. Make a request to the [/token](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#token) endpoint with these query parameters:
   * `grant_type`: set to `client_credentials`
   * `scope`: set to a space-separated list of the [Okta API scopes](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/#scopes-and-supported-endpoints) required by the app. This parameter can't be empty.

   Request example:

   ```bash
   curl --request POST \
     --url https://${customerOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/token \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Basic MG9hY...' \
     --header 'Cache-control: no-cache' \
     --header 'Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=okta.users.read okta.groups.read'
   ```

1. If the request is successful, the token is returned in the body of the response.

   Successful response example:

   ```json
   {
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJ.....UfThlJ7w",
      "scope": "okta.users.read okta.groups.read"
   }
   ```

   Error response example:

   ```json
   {
      "error": "invalid_client",
      "error_description": "The client secret supplied for a confidential client is invalid."
   }
   ```

   See the [list of token endpoint errors](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#possible-errors-4).

> **Note:** By default, the access token expires in an hour. You need to request a new access token after your token expires.

### Make Okta API requests

When you have an access token, you can use it to make requests to the [Okta management APIs](/docs/reference/core-okta-api/). Set the access token as a bearer token in an Authorization header.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://${customerOktaDomain}/api/v1/users"
    -H "Accept: application/json"
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${accessToken}"
```

### Test your API service flow

Use the credentials from your test integration (Okta domain, client ID, and secret) to test your service app. You can use the [interface that you build](#save-customer-credentials) or enter the credentials manually to configure your service app. Trigger a process from your service app to access Okta endpoints and verify that the process works as intended.

After you complete testing and are satisfied with your API service integration, you can [submit it to Okta](#submit-for-review) for verification.

### Edit your API service integration submission

To edit your API service integration submission fields:

1. From the [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com/), click **Edit** next to your integration submission.
1. Edit the fields that you want to modify.

The OIN Manager saves the values in the fields automatically.

If the fields that you update affect the test integration instance in your Okta org (such as integration name or scopes), then you must click **Test in Okta** to create another test integration instance with the updated fields. The test integration instance is a static snapshot of your integration submission fields at the time it was created. It doesn't get updated when you modify your submission. If you want to remove older test integration instances that aren't used, see [Remove your test integration instance](#remove-your-test-integration-instance).

### Remove your test integration instance

To remove a test API service integration in your Okta org, click **Revoke** from the integration details page in your Okta Admin Console. This action revokes the scope grants, client ID, and secret from the test integration installed previously.

You can click **Test in Okta** again from the OIN Manager to install another test integration instance in your Okta org. This action is useful when you update your submission in the OIN Manager (for example, modifying the scopes or name of the integration) and want to see the updates reflected in the test integration instance.

### Submit for review

After you test your API service integration and specify all fields and artifacts in the OIN Manager, you can submit your integration to Okta.

1. Sign in to [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com/) and click **Edit** next to your API service integration submission.
1. From the **API Service** tab, click **Submit for Review** on the right side of your page.

   A dialog appears and displays the completed submission tabs.

   > **Note:** The **Submit for Review** option isn't available if there are missing required fields in the submission.

1. Click **Submit for Review** from the dialog to confirm the submission.

The system notifies the Okta OIN team, and your submission goes through a series of testing and verification processes. The OIN team emails you for required updates and corrections. The OIN Manager also displays the latest status of your submission.

When your integration reaches the Publish stage, your integration is available on the OIN catalog and your customers can see an option to install it from their Okta org.
