title: Token expiration and deactivation
---

Tokens expire automatically after a certain period and can also be deactivated at any time.

#### Token expiration

Tokens are valid for 30 days from creation or last use, so that the 30 day expiration automatically refreshes with each API call.

Tokens that aren't used for 30 days expire.

The 30-day period is currently fixed and can't be changed for your organization.

#### Token deactivation

If a user account is deactivated in Okta, any API token created by that user account is deprovisioned at the same time.
