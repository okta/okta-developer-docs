Whether you are an independent software vendor (ISV), an existing Okta customer, an IT systems administrator, or a developer new to Okta, you need to know how to set up and test your cloud-based application and API endpoints to successfully deploy an Okta integration using SCIM provisioning.

If you need more detail on the concepts behind lifecycle management with SCIM and Okta, see [Understanding SCIM](/docs/concepts/scim/).

While many ISVs have custom APIs for managing user accounts, this guide assumes that you use the [System for Cross-domain Identity Management](http://www.simplecloud.info) (SCIM) protocol, an industry standard that supports all of the needed features for lifecycle provisioning. For more technical details on how you can take advantage of the SCIM API with Okta, see our [SCIM Protocol reference](/docs/reference/scim/).

Your Okta integration should use Single Sign-On (SSO) to initiate end-user authentication. Learn how to set up your integration with SSO in our [Build a Single Sign-On (SSO) integration](/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/) guide.

## Submit your integration

After you have prepared and tested your SCIM integration, and you want to make it public, you can follow the steps in our [Submit an app integration](/docs/guides/submit-app) guide to have it published in the [Okta Integration Network (OIN) catalog](https://www.okta.com/integrations/).
