title: Build a SCIM provisioning integration
---

Whether you are an independent software vendor (ISV), an existing Okta customer, an IT systems administrator, or a developer new to Okta, you need to know how to set up and test your API service and application so that you can successfully deploy a provisioning integration using SCIM with Okta.

After you have prepared and tested your integration, you can then [submit your app](/docs/guides/submit-app) to be published in the [Okta Integration Network (OIN) catalog](https://www.okta.com/integrations/).

If you need more detail on the concepts behind lifecycle management with SCIM and Okta, see [Provisioning with Okta Lifecycle Management](/docs/concepts/scim/).

While many ISVs have custom APIs for managing user accounts, Okta recommends that you use the [System for Cross-domain Identity Management](http://www.simplecloud.info) (SCIM) protocol, an industry standard that supports all of the needed features for lifecycle provisioning. For more technical details on how you can take advantage of the SCIM API with Okta, see our [SCIM Protocol reference](/docs/reference/scim/).

If you need help, post your question on the [Okta Developer Forums](https://devforum.okta.com/), or email us at <developers@okta.com>
