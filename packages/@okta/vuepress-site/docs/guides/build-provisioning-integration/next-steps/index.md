You should now have a SCIM integration that has been successfully built and tested.

After you have completed your testing and your integration is working as expected, you can start the submission process to have your integration included in the [Okta Integration Network](https://www.okta.com/okta-integration-network/) (OIN).

Our [Submit an app integration](/docs/guides/submit-app) guide takes you through the steps required to submit your SCIM integration through the OIN Manager site.
