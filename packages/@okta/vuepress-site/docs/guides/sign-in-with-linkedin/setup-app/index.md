1.3. Save the OAuth client ID and secret values so you can add them to the Okta configuration in the next section.

1.4. Under "Default Application Permissions", make sure that `r_liteprofile` and `r_emailaddress` are selected. You can leave the "Authorized redirect URLs" section blank for now, you will return to it later.
