## 5. Publish to Okta Integration Network (OIN) in Partner-Built EA

Okta recently changed the process by which an ISV can publish their integration into the Okta Integration Network (OIN). Now, before becoming Okta-verified, publish to the OIN in Partner-Built EA. Publishing in Partner-Built allows customers to easily discover your integration in the OIN and work directly with the you (the ISV) to validate and deploy your integration without Okta Interference.

> Note: Partner-Built EA application features have been verified and tested by Okta but may not have been deployed or used by a customer in an Okta production environment. We recommend that you fully test these integrations for your own provisioning use-cases before deploying in production for your end users.

In order for an app to be published in the Okta Integration Network in Partner-Built EA, it must meet the following criteria:

* Include an ISV configuration guide explaining:
  * The supported features
  * Step-by-step instructions for setting up the integration
* Gotchas & known issues
* Support and Contact Info
* ISV Support Contact
* ISV Escalation Contact
* Full, permanent test tenant provided to Okta
* RunScope Test Suite
* Final Full QA by Okta

Once Okta completes the QA process and the requisite changes are made (all issues are closed), Okta allows the provisioning integration to enter the Okta Integration Network in Partner-Built EA.
