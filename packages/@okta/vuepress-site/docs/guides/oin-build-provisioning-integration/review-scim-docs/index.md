The first step is to build a compliant SCIM server. Even if you already support SCIM, it is important that you review Okta’s SCIM docs to understand the specifics of Okta’s support for the SCIM standard:

* [Required SCIM Server Capabilities](/docs/concepts/oin-scim/#required-scim-server-capabilities/)
