* [Include App-specific information in a custom claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-returned-from-okta/create-app-profile-attribute/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a dynamic whitelist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-dynamic/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a static whitelist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-static/)
