title: Scopes & supported endpoints
---

Every action on an endpoint that supports OAuth 2.0 requires a specific scope. Okta scopes have the following format: `okta.<resource name>.<operation>`. For example, you can have resources that are users, clients, or apps with `read` or `manage` operations. The `read` scope is used to read information about a resource. The `manage` scope is used to create a new resource, manage a resource, or delete a resource. Use the `okta.<resource>.read` scopes to perform GET API operations and the `okta.<resource>.manage` scopes to perform POST, PUT, and DELETE API operations. The self scopes (`okta.<resource>.<operation>.self`) only allow access to the user who authorized the token. These scopes are used to perform end user API operations.

The following table shows the scopes that are currently available:

## Scope Naming

The available scopes exist in a hierarchy, so that the `manage` scopes can do everything that the `read` scopes do, but more. Additionally, the `self` scopes only allow for access to the user who authorized the token. For example, a `GET` request to the `/users` endpoint with the `okta.users.read` scope returns all the users that the admin has access to. If the same request is sent with the `okta.users.read.self` scope, only the current user's account returns.

## Silent Downscoping

The Okta [Org Authorization Server](/docs/concepts/auth-servers/) returns all scopes that you request as long as the client app is permitted to use that scope (granted to the client app). It doesn't matter whether you have permissions for all the scopes that you request. If the scopes requested exist in the app's grants collection, those scopes are sent back in the access token. However, when you make a request to perform an action that you don't have permission to perform, the token doesn't work and you receive an error.

For example, if you are a Read Only Admin and request an access token that contains the `okta.authorizationServers.manage` scope and that scope exists in the client's grants collection, the access token returned contains that scope. However, the access token doesn't work when you try to modify an authorization server on `/api/v1/authorizationServers` because you lack the permissions.
