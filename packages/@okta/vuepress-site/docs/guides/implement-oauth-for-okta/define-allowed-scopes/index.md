title: Define allowed scopes
---

When a request is sent to the Okta Org Authorization Server's `/authorize` endpoint, it validates all of the requested scopes in the request against the app's grants collection. The scope is granted if it exists in the app's grants collection.

> **Note:** Only the Super Admin role has permissions to grant scopes to an app.

1. From the Developer Console, click **Applications**, and then select the OpenID Connect (OIDC) or OAuth 2.0 app that you want to add grants to.
2. Select the **Okta API Scopes** tab and then click **Grant** for each of the scopes that you want to add to the application's grant collection.

Alternatively, you can add grants using the `/grants` API. The following is an example request to create a grant for the `okta.users.read` scope.

```JSON
    curl -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "scopeId": "okta.users.read",
          "issuer": "https://{yourOktaDomain}"
    }' "https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/apps/client_id/grants"
```

> **Note:** You can find a list of available values for `scopeId` in the <GuideLink link="../scopes">Scopes and supported endpoints</GuideLink> section.
