In Okta Classic Engine when a user doesn't have a session, the more restrictive policy is evaluated first, such as the Okta sign-on policy or the application sign-on policy. Additionally, if an assurance requirement is more restrictive, such as an `acr_values` parameter, that is evaluated first. The second most restrictive policy or assurance requirement is then evaluated and so on. When a user already has a session, the application sign-on policy is always evaluated first. Then, the `acr_values` parameter in the request.

In both Identity Engine and Classic Engine, if the user has a session, the previously satisfied authenticators are considered before prompting for factors that are required by the `acr_values` parameter in the request. Additionally, if the user is unable to satisfy the level of assurance, Okta returns an [error](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-unmet-authentication-requirements-1_0.html) (`error=unmet_authentication_requirements`) to the callback endpoint.
