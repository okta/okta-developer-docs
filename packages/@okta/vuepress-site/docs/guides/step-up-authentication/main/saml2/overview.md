Today, Okta relies on [authentication policies](/docs/reference/api/policy/#authentication-policy) to authenticate the user. After Okta identifies and authenticates the user, Okta issues the SAML assertion. Although this approach works in many situations, there are several circumstances where more is needed. Resource servers (your protected APIs) can require different authentication strengths or elapsed time frames for different use cases. For example, an eCommerce application requires different authentication strengths depending on whether the item being purchased exceeds a certain threshold. Another example is an application that requires a higher level of assurance before making changes to sensitive information.

Okta has created predefined `acr_values` that are described in the [Predefined parameter values](#predefined-parameter-values) section. You can include one of these values, based on your use case, in the `AuthnRequest` to request a different authentication assurance. Okta returns SAML assertion that contains the `acr` claim. This claim conveys information about the level of assurance that the user verified at the time of authentication. The resource server can then validate these parameters to ensure that the user verified the required level of assurance.
