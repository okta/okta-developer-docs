8. Build your issuer URL, which is the URL of the authorization server that performs the authentication. In this example, we use the "default" Custom Authorization Server. The issuer is a combination of your Org URL (found in the global header located in the upper-right corner of the Admin Console) and `/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration`. For example: `https://example-1234.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

    > **Note:** If you are using a custom domain to reference the issuer, make sure that you also configure the Custom Authorization Server to [reflect the custom domain](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/update-other-okta-settings/#authorization-server-issuer). Otherwise, there is a mismatch between the issuer in the request and the tokens minted.
