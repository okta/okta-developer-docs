Allowing a user to change their primary email is a critical task when they only use their username and email address to sign in to your app. Much like a password, a user must be able to change their email address, especially if it becomes compromised. In your backend app that uses the <StackSnippet snippet="sdklink" inline/> for authentication, use the <StackSnippet snippet="mgmtsdklink" inline/> to enable your users to change their primary emails.

>**Note**: The <StackSnippet snippet="mgmtsdklink" inline/> uses the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/) to update the user's profile information.
