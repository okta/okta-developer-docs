## Overview

Allowing a user to change their primary email is a critical task when they only use their username and email address to sign in to your app. Much like a password, a user must be able to change their email address, especially if it becomes compromised. With the [Okta Auth Javascript SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js) you can enable your users to change their primary emails in your app.

The SDK contains a series of [methods](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/blob/master/docs/myaccount/modules.md) that update the user's primary email address and other profile information. These methods are secure and can be safely used in browser-based SPA applications. In this guide, you learn how to use these methods to integrate the change email functionality in your app.

>**Note**: These SDK methods use the [MyAccount API](/docs/reference/api/myaccount/) to update the user's profile information.
