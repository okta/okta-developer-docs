1. Generate app instances from your updated integration and assign test users. See [Generate instances for testing](#generate-instances-for-testing).

1. Test the required flows for each of your SSO instances with the [OIN Submission Tester](/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/saml2/main/#oin-submission-tester). Fix any test failures from the OIN Submission Tester, then regenerate the test instance (if necessary) and retest.

   > **Note:** You must have the Okta Browser Plugin installed with **Allow in Incognito** enabled before you use the  **OIN Submission Tester**. See [OIN Wizard requirements](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#oin-wizard-requirements).
