The **Required app instances** section shows you the instances detected in your org that are required to test your integration.

* The **CURRENT VERSION** status indicates the instances that you need to test your current integration submission. [Generate an instance](#generate-an-instance) to test SCIM if **No instance detected** appears next to the **SCIM** label.
* The **PUBLISHED VERSION** status indicates the instances that you need to test backwards compatibility for SSO. If your integration only supports the SCIM protocol, then the OIN Wizard doesn't require a published-version instance.

Depending on the nature of your updates, you may need to generate instances for backwards-compatibility testing. Okta recommends that you execute the Runscope tests on your SCIM published-version instance for backwards compatibility, but it's not a requirement for submission.

   * If you're only updating app profiles or mapping, then you don't need to create an extra app instance for SCIM backward-compatibility testing. You can test the app profile updates in the updated instance version of your submission. See [Configure attribute mappings](#configure-attribute-mappings) when you generate a SCIM instance for testing. However, if you're updating the properties such as description, logo or guide link, then Okta recommends that you need to create an extra app instance for SCIM backward-compatibility testing.

   * If you're updating all other properties from the **Configure your integration** and **Test integration** pages, then Okta recommends SCIM backwards-compatibility testing:

      * If you tested and submitted your published integration from the same Okta Developer Edition org, you might already have an existing backwards-compatible instance. Use this older app instance version to test backwards compatibility. See [Test your integration](#test-your-integration).

      * If you don't have an instance based on the published integration, exit the OIN Wizard and create an instance of the SCIM OIN-published instance. See [Add existing app integrations](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-apps-add-app) to create an OIN-published instance for SCIM backwards-compatibility testing.

> **Notes:** If your integration also supports SSO:
> * You can avoid creating another app instance for SSO testing if these conditions apply:
>     * Your integration supports SCIM and one SSO protocol.
>     * Your integration doesn't support SSO JIT.
>     * The **Create User** SCIM operation is enabled.
> * You should already have an instance of your published integration for SSO backwards-compatibility testing. The OIN Wizard ensures that an SSO published instance is available in your org before you update your integration.  If you don't have a published-version instance for SSO testing, exit the OIN Wizard and create the SSO OIN-published instance. See [Add existing app integrations](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-apps-add-app) to create an OIN-published instance for backwards-compatibility testing.
