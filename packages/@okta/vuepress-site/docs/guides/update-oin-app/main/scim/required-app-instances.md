The **Required app instances** box shows you the instances detected in your org that are available to test your integration. It also shows you the test instances required for the OIN Submission Tester if your integration also supports SSO:

* The **CURRENT VERSION** status indicates the instances that you need to test your current integration submission.
* The **PUBLISHED VERSION** status indicates the instances that you need to test backwards compatibility for SSO.

You need to [generate an instance](#generate-instance) to test the specific protocol if **No instance detected** appears next to the protocol.
