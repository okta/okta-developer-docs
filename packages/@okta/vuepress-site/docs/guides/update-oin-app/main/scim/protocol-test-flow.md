Before you test your Okta SCIM integration, confirm that your SCIM API service is operational. Okta provides a SCIM API specification test suite in Runscope. See [Test your SCIM API](/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-prepare/main/#test-your-scim-api).

After you've successfully run the Okta SCIM API specification test suite in Runscope, save the URL of the test results. This Runscope test results URL is one of the requirements to submit your integration.
