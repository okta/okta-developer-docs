title: Try signing in
---

With the app now configured, you're ready to try signing in as an end user and see how the functionality comes together:

1. Follow the directions in the README to start the app.

2. The example apps are served by default at `localhost`. Point your browser at the URL of the app. Consult the README for default port number.

3. You should see a sign-in screen. Try signing in as the end user you created earlier.

4. If sign-in is successful, the example app confirms that.

To see the Admin view of the process that just occurred, you can open Developer Console in another browser window, signing in with your original Admin account. The Dashboard displays the number of users signed-in, and the System Log records the sign-in event.
