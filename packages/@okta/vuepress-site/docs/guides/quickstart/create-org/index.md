title: Create your Okta organization
---

You built an awesome app and you want to add user authentication to it. Let’s get you set up and working with Okta.

To start, you're going to need a free Okta developer edition org. An org is a private data space Okta provisions for you, to hold all the resources you create to handle user authentication.

An org is free, and you can use it to handle authentication for up to 1,000 users. Later, if you need more capacity, you can upgrade to a paid org.

#### Create your org

#### Next steps

Your org is now created and usable. There's a survey you’re prompted to fill out about your role, aims, and software stack, which can help us support you.

A wizard launches to help you through basic setup for a few commons scenarios. You can choose to exit the wizard by clicking **Dashboard**. (In the next sections of this QuickStart, we won’t use the wizard, but rather the regular Dashboard menus that can be used on an ongoing basis.)

You now have an org. You can create additional orgs at any time, and it's often useful to do so to support separate development environments.
