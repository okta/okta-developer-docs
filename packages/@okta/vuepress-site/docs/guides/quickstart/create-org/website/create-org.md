You can create an account manually through your browser:

1. Go to: <https://developer.okta.com/signup>

2. Fill out the form. You'll need to supply:
	 - email address
	 - first name
	 - last name
	 - company
	 - country
	 - state/province

3. Click to agree to the terms.

4. Click **Get Started**.

5. You receive an email to activate your account. The email gives you a temporary password and also lets you know your Okta domain, also known as your org URL.

	Your Okta domain is important: It’s the base URL you use to access your org.  Authorization requests for users will be directed to an endpoint that has this as its base, and any Okta API endpoints you call will also have this URL as their base.

	Record your Okta domain and your temporary password. Click the **Activate your account** button in the email.

6. You're prompted to sign in to your org. Supply your email address and the temporary password that was provided in the email.

7. You're prompted to change your password and to choose a security question to use if you forget your password. You're also prompted to choose a security image. The image is displayed whenever Okta prompts you to sign in, providing some assurance that it’s Okta asking.
