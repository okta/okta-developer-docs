In the Admin Console, complete these steps to create a web app with OpenID Connect (OIDC) sign-in:

1. Select **Applications > Applications** in the side navigation.

2. Click **Add Application**.

3. From the **Add Application** page, click **Create New App**.

4. Select **Web** for the **Platform**.
> **Note:** **Web** is typically used for applications using tokens in server-side code. For applications using tokens in Angular, React, Vue, or other browser-side code, choose **Single Page App (SPA)**.

5. Select **OpenID Connect** for the **Sign on method**.

6. Click **Create**.

7. From the **Create OpenID Connect App Integration** page, specify your **Application name**.

8. Next to **Login redirect URIs**, click **+ Add URI** to specify each login redirect URI for your app. Okta sends OAuth authorization responses to the specified URIs, which are also known as callback endpoints. For the Okta sample **Web** apps, specify `http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback` as a login redirect URI. For **SPA** samples, use `http://localhost:8080/login/callback`.

9. Next to **Logout redirect URIs**, click **+ Add URI** to specify the logout redirect URI. This setting lets you specify a URI to redirect the userâ€™s browser to when they sign out. For the Okta sample **Web** apps, you don't need to specify a logout redirect URI. For **SPA** apps, use the base URI, e.g., `http://localhost:8080`.

10. Click **Save**.

Your registered app page is displayed.

From the **General** tab, save the following client credentials for your app build:
- **Client ID**&mdash;the public identifier for the client that is required for all OAuth flows
- **Client secret**&mdash;the secret key used by the client to exchange an authorization code for a token (must be kept confidential)

Remaining in the Admin Console, navigate to **Security > API**. From the **Authorization Servers** tab, save the following value from your **default** authorization server:
- **Issuer URI**&mdash;the authorization server URI that will perform authentication

If you create a **SPA** app, make sure to register its trusted origin to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Navigate to **Security > API > Trusted Origins** and add `http://localhost:8080` (select both CORS and redirect).
