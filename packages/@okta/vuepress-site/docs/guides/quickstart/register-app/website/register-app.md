In the Admin Console, complete these steps:

1. Select **Applications > Applications** in the side navigation.

2. Click **Add Application**.

3. Select **SPA** or **Web** as the **Type of Application**. Select **SPA** if your application is using the tokens in Angular, React, Vue, or other browser-side code. Pick **Web** if your application is using the tokens solely in server-side code.

4. Enter the **Name** of your app.

5. Leave **Base URI** set to the default. This is the domain where your app runs. For this quick start guide, we use `localhost`, which is where the sample apps run by default. You might need to change the port, depending on the default port your framework uses to serve `localhost` pages.

6. For **Login redirect URIs**, enter: `http://localhost:8080/login/callback`. Okta sends OAuth authorization responses to the specified URIs, which are also known as callback endpoints.

5. Leave **Logout redirect URIs** set to the default. This setting lets you specify a URI to redirect the userâ€™s browser to when they sign out.

6. Leave **Group assignments** set to the default, which is **Everyone**. Users can only sign in to apps that they are assigned to. Group assignments let you manage assignments for large numbers of users at once.

7. For **Grant type allowed**, under "Client acting on behalf of a user", select **Authorization Code**. This is the OAuth 2.0 grant type that Okta provides.

8. Click **Done**.
