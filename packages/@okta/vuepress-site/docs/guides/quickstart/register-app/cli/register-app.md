To use the Okta CLI:

1. Enter the command: `okta apps create`.
2. Give your app a name.
3. Select **SPA** or **Web** as the **Type of Application**. Select **SPA** if your application is using the tokens in Angular, React, Vue, or other browser-side code.  Pick **Web** if your application is using the tokens solely in server-side code.
4. Accept the default **Redirect URIs**. These URIs are customizable within your app, so you don't have to use these defaults.
