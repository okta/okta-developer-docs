You need two values from the Okta application and the Admin Console that you worked with in <GuideLink link="../create-okta-application">Create an Okta application</GuideLink>:

* **Client ID** &mdash; Find it in the applications list or on the application's **General** tab.
* **Okta domain** &mdash; You can find the Okta Domain in the Admin Console's global header in the upper-right corner of the page. Click the section that displays your email and company name.  A drop-down box appears and displays general org information including the full Okta domain (for example, subdomain.okta.com).
