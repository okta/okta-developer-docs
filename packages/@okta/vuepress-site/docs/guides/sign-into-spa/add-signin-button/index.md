In your application, you want to provide a button to sign the user in. When the user clicks this button, they are redirected to the Okta-hosted sign-in page so they can authenticate.

> **Note:** To customize this sign-in page, see the [Style the Widget](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-okta-hosted/).
