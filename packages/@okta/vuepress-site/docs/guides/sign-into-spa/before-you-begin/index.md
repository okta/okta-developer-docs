This guide shows you how to use Okta as the user store for your single-page application and sign users in.

If you are building a web application rendered by a server, see [Sign users in to your web application](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/) instead.

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).
* Know the basics of building JavaScript applications.
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an existing app, or are new to building apps, start with this documentation:
