## Factor setup

This use case does not require any additional factors. It only requires you to load the widget.

## Configuration updates

If not already done, complete the steps that are described in [download and set up the SDK, widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/). The steps guide you to the appropriate repository and location of the embedded Sign-In Widget sample app, identify the packages to install, and describe additional changes to the Okta org that are required for the widget app.
