## Factor setup

This use case does not require any additional factors. It only requires that you load the Widget.

## Configuration updates

Ensure that you've completed the steps to [download and configure the SDK, Sign-In Widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/). These steps guide you to the appropriate repository and location of the embedded Sign-In Widget sample app, identify the packages to install, and describe additional changes to the Okta org that are required for the Widget.
