## Factor setup

This use case skips the factor requirements since it uses the Facebook identity provider.

## Configuration Updates

### Step 1:  Complete steps in the widget setup

If not already done, complete the steps that are described in [download and set up the SDK, widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/).

### Step 2: Set up your Okta org (for social identity providers)

If not already done, complete the steps described in the [Set up your Okta org (for social identity providers)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-social-identity-providers) section.
