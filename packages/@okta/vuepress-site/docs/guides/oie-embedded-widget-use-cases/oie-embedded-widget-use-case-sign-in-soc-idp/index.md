## Factor setup

This use case skips the factor requirements since it uses the Facebook Identity Provider.

## Configuration Updates

### Step 1:  Download and configure the widget app

Ensure that you have completed the steps that are described in the [Download and set up the SDK, Sign-In Widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/) topic. These steps guide you to the appropriate repository and location of the embedded Sign-In Widget sample app, identify the packages to install, and describe additional changes to the Okta org that are required for the widget app.

### Step 2: Set up your Okta org for social Identity Providers

Ensure that your org is configured for the Facebook Identity Provider by completing the steps in the [Set up your Okta org for social Identity Providers](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-social-identity-providers) section.
