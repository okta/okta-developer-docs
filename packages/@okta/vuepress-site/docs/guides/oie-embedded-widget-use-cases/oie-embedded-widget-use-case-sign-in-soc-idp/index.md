## Configuration updates

Before you build the Facebook IdP sign-in flow using the Widget, ensure that you've [set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case).

After you've set up your Okta org for the social IdP use case, [download and configure the SDK, Sign-In Widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/-/main/). These steps guide you to the appropriate repository and location of the embedded Sign-In Widget sample app, identify the packages to install, and describe additional changes to the Okta org that are required for the Widget.
