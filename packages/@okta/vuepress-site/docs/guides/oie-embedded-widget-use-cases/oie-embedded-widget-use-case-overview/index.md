## Start with a use case

Using the sample app as your guide, walk through each of the use cases in this section to build your app with the Widget. Each use case describes the steps required to integrate your app with the Widget.

The supported use cases are as follows:

* [Load the Widget](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-load/)
* [Basic sign-in flow using the Widget](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-basic-sign-in/)
* [Sign in with Facebook](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-sign-in-soc-idp/)

These use cases are enable you to start with simple use cases before you advance to more complex scenarios.

> **Note:** The code samples for each use case are primarily based on the sample app that is provided with the SDK.
