This guide explains how to set up end-user driven account management in your org using the MyAccount API.

> **Note:** This guide is for the enhanced MyAccount API, accessible at `/idp/myaccount`. The `/api/v1/myaccount` endpoint is deprecated. See [MyAccount API (deprecated)](/docs/reference/api/archive-myaccount/) for the docs of the older API version.

> **Note:** This guide is only for Okta Identity Engine. See [Identify your Okta solution](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-oie-version) to determine your Okta version.

<!-- > **Note:** This guide covers a narrow set of use cases that call the MyAccount API. Most use cases are covered by the SDKs. See -->

---
**Learning outcomes**

* Set up your org with the required scopes to call the MyAccount API.
* Allow your end users to call the API to update their profile and enroll another authenticator after they first sign in.

**What you need**

* [Okta Developer Edition organization](https://developer.okta.com/signup)
* Access to the latest version of the MyAccount API: `/idp/myaccount`
* An existing OpenID Connect client app in Okta for testing in Okta
* [Postman client](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) to test requests. See [Get Started with the Okta APIs](https://developer.okta.com/code/rest/) for information on setting up Postman.
* The MyAccount API Postman collection that allows you to test the API calls that are described in this guide. Click **Run in Postman** to add the collection to your Postman workspace.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/9cb68745dbf85ae3a871)

> **Note:** To run the Postman collection, you need an end-user access token. Use an [SDK](/docs/guides/auth-js/main/#handle-responses) to get the token.

## About user-scoped account management

The MyAccount API now provides user-scoped endpoints that don’t require admin tokens. End users only need a bearer token to update their profile, or email and phone authenticators. In addition, app developers can call the MyAccount API for active users outside of the authentication context. For example, after a user enrolls in the mandatory email factor and completes authentication, app developers can call the API to enroll the active user with the optional phone authenticator.

## About the Postman collection

It is up to you how you set up users to call the MyAccount API to manage their account. In this guide, we provide sample API calls using a Postman collection to demonstrate them in a language/platform neutral way.

> **Note:** To run the Postman collection, you need an end-user access token. Use an [SDK](/docs/guides/auth-js/-/main/) to get the token.

## API versioning

A valid API version in the `Accept` header is required to access the API. Current version: V1.0.0

```bash
Accept: application/json; okta-version=1.0.0
```

## Access Token assurance

MyAccount operations that create, update, or delete resources require access tokens that are 15 minutes old or younger. API calls with access tokens older than 15 minutes require re-authentication. If you don't re-authenticate the token, the API returns a 403 error with the following content in the header:

```bash
www-authenticate: Bearer realm="IdpMyAccountAPI", error="insufficient_authentication_context", error_description="The access token requires additional assurance to access the resource", max_age=900
```

## Grant the required scopes

> **Note:** If you have a custom authorization server, the MyAccount API-related scopes are granted by default. See [Create an authorization server](/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/-/main/).

When you are ready to grant the required scopes, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account and go to **Applications** > **Applications**.
1. Open your OpenID Connect client app.
1. On the **Okta API Scopes** tab, grant the following scopes:
   * For access to both GET and POST/DELETE endpoints:
      * `okta.myAccount.email.manage`
      * `okta.myAccount.phone.manage`
      * `okta.myAccount.profile.manage`
   * For access to GET endpoints only:
      * `okta.myAccount.email.read`
      * `okta.myAccount.phone.read`
      * `okta.myAccount.profile.read`
