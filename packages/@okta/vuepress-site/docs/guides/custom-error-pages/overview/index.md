You can [customize the Okta-hosted sign-in page](/docs/guides/custom-hosted-signin/) to fit your application's look and feel, but that's just one piece of a seamless user experience. If an error occurs during sign-in, Okta may need to display an error page to the user. You can customize the error page using an embedded HTML editor provided on the **Custom Error Pages** tab of the **Customization** page. 

By using this feature along with [customize the Okta URL domain](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/) and [customize the Okta-hosted sign-in page](/docs/guides/custom-hosted-signin/), you can use Okta-hosted flows and create a fully customized end-user sign-in experience.

## Common questions
**In what situations does Okta serve error pages to the user?**
The error page appears when a critical error occurs or an application is misconfigured. See [Okta-hosted flows](/docs/concepts/okta-hosted-flows/) for more information on Okta-hosted functionality. 

**What can I customize on the error page?**
You can add any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript you want to the page.

## Before you begin
Before you can get started customizing error pages, you must have already [customized your Okta URL domain](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/). A custom error page appears only when an application connects to Okta using your custom domain. Otherwise, the default Okta error page appears.
