When using an Okta-hosted flow, you can create a unique sign-in experience by providing a customized [Okta URL domain](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/) and creating an [Style the Widget](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-okta-hosted/) that matches your application's look and feel.

However, if an error occurs during sign-in, Okta may need to display an error page to the user. To provide a seamless user experience, you can also customize the error page by using the embedded HTML editor provided on the **Custom Error Pages** tab of the **Customization** page.

## Common questions

**In what situations does Okta serve error pages to the user?**

The error page appears when a critical error occurs or an application is misconfigured. See [Okta-hosted flows](/docs/concepts/okta-hosted-flows/) for more information on Okta-hosted functionality.

**What can I customize on the error page?**

You can add any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript you want to the page.

## Before you begin

Before you can get started customizing error pages, you must have already [customized your Okta URL domain](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/).

A custom error page appears only when an application connects to Okta using your custom domain. Otherwise, the default Okta error page appears.
