title: Overview of the mobile Identity Engine SDK

Design the implementation of sign-in for your mobile app by understanding the objects and messages that represent the sign-in flow.

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" /><br>

## Introduction

Integrate the Okta sign-in flow into your app in one of two ways:

- Redirect the request to Okta which handles the flow in its own window (the redirect model).
- Handle each step in the flow by building the appropriate user interface elements, capturing the information, and updating Okta (the embedded model).

This guide is an overview of building your own user interface using the embedded model. For information on the redirect model, see <StackSnippet snippet="redirectquickstart" inline />.

## Sign-in flow

Okta supports many ways of authenticating the identity of a user during the sign-in flow. An Okta org administrator creates _policies_, different mixes of *authenticators*, or ways of verifying the identity of a user, and assigns them to apps, people, groups, and more. Policies also configure whether an authenticator is required or optional and the minimum number required to sign in successfully. Responding to each authenticator is a step in the sign-in flow. Many flows require multiple *factors* (multifactor authentication), the category of an authenticator. Factor types include biometrics, such as a fingerprint, knowledge, such as a password, and more. This effectively results in an infinite number of combinations of authenticators and the order in which they're presented.

The Android and Swift Identity Engine SDKs represent the sign-in flow as a state machine. The Swift SDK is used for iOS. You initialize the machine with the details of your Okta org app integration, request the initial step in the flow, and cycle through responding to steps until either the user signs in, cancels, or an error occurs.

</div>

Each sign-in step may include one or more possible user actions, such as:

- Choosing an authenticator, such as Okta Verify or security questions.
- Entering a one-time passcode (OTP).
- Cancelling the sign-in flow.

## Sign-in objects

The SDK represents the sign-in flow using a number of different objects:

</div>

- **Response:** The top-level object that represents a step and contains all the other objects. It includes a property that indicates a successful sign-in and functions for cancelling the sign-in flow, or retrieving the access token after the sign-in flow succeeds. A response may contain multiple authenticators and remediations.
- **Remediation:** Represents the main user actions for a step, such as enrolling in an authenticator or entering an OTP. In the Swift SDK for iOS, it also includes the function for requesting the next step in the flow.
- **Authenticator:** Represents an authenticator that's used to verify the identity of a user, such as Okta Verify.
- **Method:** Represents a channel for an authenticator, such as using SMS or voice for an authenticator that uses a phone. An authenticator may have zero or more methods.
- **Capability:** A user action or additional information that is associated with a remediation, authenticator, or method, such as requesting a new OTP or a redacted email.
- **Field:** Represents a UI element, either a static item, such as a label, or user input, such as a selection list. It includes properties for state information, such as whether the associated value is required. Properties also store the current value of user input field, such as the string for an OTP or the selected choice. A lists of choices, or **Options**, are represented by a collection of fields. A field may contain a form that contains more fields.
- **Form:** Contains the fields that represent the user action for a remediation.
- **InteractionCodeFlow:** Represents the session during the sign-in flow. In the Android SDK, it includes the function for requesting the next step in the flow.


## Objects and the flow

<StackSnippet snippet="objectsandflow" />

## Manage the flows

Add support for the sign-in and sign-out flows to your app:

- Initialize the flow.
- Start the flow.
- Process responses until the sign-in flow succeeds, results in an error, or the user cancels the flow.
- Request a token object for a successful sign-in flow. The object contains access, ID, and refresh tokens.
- Sign the user out.


### Add the SDK

Before you add support you need to add the SDK to your project.

<StackSnippet snippet="adddependency" />

### Initialize the flow

Configure the flow with the information it needs to communicate with your Okta org application integration:

| Value         | Description |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| Issuer        | The OAuth 2.0 URL for the Okta org, such as `https://oie-123456.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default`. |
| Client ID     | The ID of the Okta app integration from the Okta Admin Console.  |
| Redirect URI  | A callback URI for launching the mobile app, such as `com.example.oie-123456:/callback`. |
| Scopes        | A space separated list of the requested access scopes for the app. For more information, see [Scopes in OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/#scopes).|

The configuration information in a shipping app is usually static. You can initialize the configuration values directly in the code or read them from a file. During development you may want to provide a way to edit configuration values.

<StackSnippet snippet="initializeflow" />

### Start the sign-in flow

Start the sign-in flow after initializing an `InteractionCodeFlow` object.

<StackSnippet snippet="initializingsdksession" />

### Process the response

The steps for processing a response are:

1. Check if the sign-in flow succeeded.
1. Check for messages, such as an invalid password.
1. Check for remediations.
1. Process the remediations.
1. Process the authenticators.

After the user enters any required information, update the remediation and request the next step.

<StackSnippet snippet="processresponse" />

### Complete the sign-in flow

Check for a successful completion of the sign-in flow at each step, and in the case of success, exchange the remediation for an access token and exit the flow.

<StackSnippet snippet="gettingatoken" />

### Sign out a user

Sign out a user by revoking the access token granted when the user signed in, and by revoking a refresh token if one exists.

<StackSnippet snippet="signingout" />

## Sign-in flow UI

There are two general approaches for adding the sign-in flow to your app: add a fixed number of authentication methods, possibly in a fixed order, or generate the user interface dynamically based on the response at each step.

For a fixed number of methods (a static UI), you create appropriate views and populate them from the response. Using a static UI introduces risk as both the authentication methods and the order may be changed at any time by an administrator of your Okta org. There are three requirements to reduce that risk:

- Update the code in the app before policy changes are enabled.
- Distribute the updated app to users before the policy changes are enabled.
- Ensure all your users' devices use the updated.

The usual way to satisfy the last condition is with an enterprise-managed workforce app. Also note that there's additional risks as external events may require an immediate policy change that can result in the inability of mobile users to sign in.

For consumer apps, and to reduce the risk for enterprise apps, a safer choice is building the user interface from the current sign-in step, by presenting a dynamic UI.

For an example of implementing a dynamic UI, see <StackSnippet snippet="dynamicuisample" inline />.
