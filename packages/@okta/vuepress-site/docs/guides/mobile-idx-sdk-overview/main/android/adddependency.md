To add the SDK to your app, include the following dependency in your `app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'com.okta.android:okta-idx-kotlin:$okta_sdk_version'
```

Change `$okta.sdk.version` to the desired release version of the SDK. For a list of released versions, see [the list tags for the SDK releases](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-android/tags).
