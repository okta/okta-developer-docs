You install or upgrade the Identity Engine SDK to your application by downloading the latest version of the Okta Authentication JavaScript SDK (`okta-auth-js`). The latest SDK contains libraries for both the Classic Engine Authentication and Identity Engine.

Use a package manager (npm or yarn) to install the latest version of the Auth JS SDK for your applications:

```bash
npm install @okta/okta-auth-js@latest
```
