Your Okta-integrated application may include the following Classic Engine Java libraries:

* Okta Java Management SDK ([okta/okta-sdk-java](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java))
* Okta Java Authentication SDK ([okta/okta-auth-java](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-java))
* Okta JWT Verifier for Java ([okta/okta-auth-java](https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-java))
* Okta Spring Boot Starter ([okta/okta-spring-boot](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot))

You can add the latest Identity Engine Java SDK package to your app, in addition to the existing Classic Engine Java libraries that your app already depends on.
