After adding the SDK to your app, upgrade your authentication use cases to the Identity Engine SDK. See [Upgrade your application to the Okta Identity Engine SDK](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-api-sdk-to-oie-sdk/aspnet/main/) to learn how to map your existing implementations to the Identity Engine SDK. Also, check out the [sample apps](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-run-samples) to see working examples of all the supported use cases using the Identity Engine SDK.
