After you upgrade your app to the minimum requirements, the next step is to add the Identity Engine SDK to your app. Use the Nuget Package Manager to install the latest version of the `Okta.Idx.Sdk` package. You can accomplish this in two ways:

### Install using the Nuget Package Manager

1. Right-click your project in the Solution Explorer and choose **Manage Nuget Packages...**

1. Under the **Browse** tab, search for **Okta.Idx.Sdk**. Select and install the package.

### Install using the Package Manager Console

1. Select **View** > **Other Windows** > **Package Manager Console**.

1. In the console window, run `install-package Okta.Idx.Sdk`.
