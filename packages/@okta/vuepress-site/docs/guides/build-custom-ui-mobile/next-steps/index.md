You should now understand how to build a custom ui in your mobile application. If you got stuck, post a question in our [Developer Forums](https://devforum.okta.com).

## What's next
When a user signs in, their profile information (stored in Okta) is made available to your application. It's common to use this information to update your app's UI.

See [Get info about the user](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/get-user-info/) in the Sign users in to your mobile app guide for the steps. 

## Sample applications

We publish full sample applications on GitHub. If you want to see everything working together, clone or download one of our samples and try it out.
