Next, you need to add Okta to your application by installing and configuring our SDK.

You should already have added and configured packages when you walked through the [Sign users in to your mobile app](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/android/configure-packages/) guide.

Then, you need to install one additional package: the Okta Authentication SDK. This SDK works together with the OpenID Connect SDK that you already installed to make authentication requests to Okta from your own views.
