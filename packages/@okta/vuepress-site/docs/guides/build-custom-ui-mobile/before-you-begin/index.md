title: Before you begin
---
You can connect your mobile app to Okta and sign users in by [opening a browser](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/before-you-begin/). But, if you prefer that your users not leave your app, you need to build a custom sign-in UI with native controls and screens instead. Use this guide to build a customized sign-in experience inside your mobile application.

This guide assumes that:

* You have an Okta Developer organization. Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).
* You have an app that you want to add a custom UI to
* You have already walked through the [Sign users in to your mobile app](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/) guide.

> **Note:** If the browser sign-in works for your application, we recommend using that since building a custom sign-in UI takes more effort and development time.
