title: Sign the CSR
---

Follow the third-party process that your company uses to sign the CSR. You can't move to step four until the process is completed, as the signed CSR is required to continue.

**Note:** The CSR is generated in Base64 DER format. If your process requires a different format, convert it using OpenSSL or a third-party decoder. Free, third-party decoders are readily available.
