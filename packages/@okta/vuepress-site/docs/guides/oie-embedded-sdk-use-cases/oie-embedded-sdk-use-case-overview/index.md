## Start with a use case

With the sample app as your guide, walk through each of the use cases in this section to build your own app with the SDK. Each use case describes the steps that are required to integrate your app with the SDK.

The supported use cases include:

* [Basic sign-in flow using the password factor](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-in/)
* [User sign out](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-out/)
* [Sign in with Facebook](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-soc-idp/)
* [User password recovery](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-pwd-recovery-mfa/)
* [Self registration](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-self-reg/)
* [Sign in with password and email factor](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-pwd-email/)
* [Sign in with password and phone factor](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-pwd-phone/)

The above use cases are purposely ordered to start you off with simpler use cases before advancing to the more complex scenarios, so that you can test each one as you gradually move on.

> **Note:** The code samples for each use case are based primarly off of the sample app that is provided with the SDK.
