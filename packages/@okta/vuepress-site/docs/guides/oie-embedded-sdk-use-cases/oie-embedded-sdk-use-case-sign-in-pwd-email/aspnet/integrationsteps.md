### Step 1: Build a sign-in page on the client

Build a sign-in page that captures both the userâ€™s name and
password. An example is shown below:

<div class="common-image-format">

![Sign-in page](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-sign-on-screenshot-sign-in.png
 "Sign-in page")

</div>

### Step 2: Authenticate user credentials

When the user initiates the sign-in (for example, by clicking the **Continue** button), create an `AuthenticationOptions` object and set the `Username` and `Password` properties to the values entered in by the user. Send this object to the `AuthenticateAsync` method for the `IdxClient`.

```csharp
 var idxAuthClient = new IdxClient();
 var authnOptions = new Okta.Idx.Sdk.AuthenticationOptions()
      {
          Username = model.UserName,
          Password = model.Password,
      };

var authnResponse = await idxAuthClient.AuthenticateAsync(authnOptions).ConfigureAwait
(false);
```

### Step 3: Handle the response from the sign-in

If the username and password are valid, `AuthenticateAsync` should return an `AuthenticationStatus` of `AwaitingChallengeAuthenticatorSelection`. The `AwaitingChallengeAuthenticatorSelection` status indicates that an additional factor needs to be verified before the sign-in. In addition to the status, the `Authenticators` property should return the **email** factor.

The user should be redirected to the authenticator list page that displays the email factor as an authenticator to be verified. See the following sample code for more details.

```csharp
var authnResponse = await _idxClient.AuthenticateAsync(authnOptions).ConfigureAwait(false);
Session["idxContext"] = authnResponse.IdxContext;

switch (authnResponse?.AuthenticationStatus)
     {
         ...
         case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingChallengeAuthenticatorSelection:
              Session["authenticators"] =
              ViewModelHelper.ConvertToAuthenticatorViewModelList(authnResponse.Authenticators);
              Session["isChallengeFlow"] = true;
              return RedirectToAction("SelectAuthenticator", "Manage");
```

### Step 4: Show email factor in authenticator list

The next step is to show the email factor to the user in an authenticator list page. If not already done, this page needs to be built and display the list of authenticators from the previous step. In this use case, only the **email** factor is displayed, as shown in the following sample.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Email verify](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-pwd-email-screen-verify.png
 "Email verify")

</div>

### Step 5: Call SelectChallengeAuthenticatorAsync

When the user selects the **email** factor, a call to `SelectChallengeAuthenticatorAsync` is made that sends a verification code to the user's email. The method accepts a `SelectAuthenticatorOptions` parameter, which is used to pass in the email factor ID.

If the call is successful, the method should return `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification`, which indicates that the SDK is ready for the verification code. The next step is to redirect the user to the email verification code page.

```csharp
var selectAuthenticatorOptions = new SelectAuthenticatorOptions
                       {
                           AuthenticatorId = model.AuthenticatorId,
                       };

selectAuthenticatorResponse = await
     _idxClient.SelectChallengeAuthenticatorAsync(selectAuthenticatorOptions,
     (IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);

     Session["IdxContext"] = selectAuthenticatorResponse.IdxContext;

switch (selectAuthenticatorResponse?.AuthenticationStatus)
{
...
     case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification:
          return RedirectToAction("VerifyAuthenticator", "Manage");
```

### Step 6: Show email verification code page

If not already done, build the email verification code page that will accept the code from the email.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Email verify](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-verify-email-code.png
 "Email verify")

</div>

### Step 7: Call VerifyAuthenticatorAsync

The next step is to call `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync`. In the email verification use case, the code passed into `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync` will be the code found in the verification email.

```csharp
var idxAuthClient = new IdxClient(null);
           var verifyAuthenticatorOptions = new VerifyAuthenticatorOptions
           {
               Code = code,
           };

var authnResponse = await idxAuthClient.VerifyAuthenticatorAsync(verifyAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["idxContext"]);
```

### Step 8: Handle response from VerifyAuthenticatorAsync

The next step is to handle the response from `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync`. If the email code was valid, the method should return an `AuthenticationStatus` of `Success`. This status signifies that there are no more factors waiting to be enrolled and verified. If the steps described in [Set up your Okta org (for multi-factor use cases)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-multifactor-use-cases) were properly followed, the user has successfully signed in and should be sent to the default sign-in home page, which is the user profile page in the sample app.

```csharp
var authnResponse = await _idxClient.VerifyAuthenticatorAsync(verifyAuthenticatorOptions,
    (IIdxContext)Session["idxContext"]);
    Session["idxContext"] = authnResponse.IdxContext;
    switch (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus)
         {
              ...
              case AuthenticationStatus.Success:
                   ClaimsIdentity identity = await
                   AuthenticationHelper.GetIdentityFromTokenResponseAsync(
                   _idxClient.Configuration, authnResponse.TokenInfo);
                   _authenticationManager.SignIn(new AuthenticationProperties(), identity);
                   return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
         }
```

### Step 9: Get user profile information (optional)

Optionally, you can obtain basic user information after a successful sign-in by making a request to Okta's Open ID Connect authorization server. See [Get user profile information](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-in/#get-user-profile-information).
