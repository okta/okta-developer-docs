Self-service registration allows users to sign up for your app themselves.
In this use case, we require the user to register with the password and email or SMS factors. To enable self-service registration, perform the
following steps:

1. Enable the self-service registration option for your app in the Okta org.
1. Build the self-service registration flow in your app.

## Factor setup

This use case requires the password and either the email
or the phone factor.
