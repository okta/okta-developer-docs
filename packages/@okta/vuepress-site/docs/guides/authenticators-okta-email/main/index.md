## Overview

With the Embedded SDK, your app can verify a user's identity using the email authenticator. You can integrate the email enrollment and challenge in your app and complete those flows using <StackSnippet snippet="emloverview" inline />, a one-time passcode (OTP), or a combination of both.

## Get started

This guide walks you through the email authenticator user journeys for both magic links and OTP and details how to integrate the email enrollment and challenge flows into your app. For more details, see the following sections in this guide:

## Update configurations

Before you can start using the email authenticator, you need to enable it in your Okta org and assign it an authentication policy that requires the email authenticator.

### Add the email authenticator to your org

First, add the email authenticator to your org and enable it for both authentication and recovery.

1. Open the **Admin Console** for your org.
2. Choose **Security > Authenticators** to show the available authenticators.
3. If the **Email** authenticator isn't in the list:
    <br><br>
    a. Click **Add Authenticator**.
    <br><br>
    b. Click **Add** on the **Email** tile.
    <br><br>
    c. Select the **Authentication and recovery** option, and then click **Save**.
    <br><br>
   If the **Email** authenticator is in the list:
      <br><br>
      a. Click the **Actions** menu for the **Email** authenticator.
      <br><br>
      b. Click **Edit**.
      <br><br>
      c. Select the **Authentication and recovery** option, and then click **Save**.
      <br><br>
4. Select the **Enrollment** tab.
5. Check that **Email** is set to either **Optional** or **Required** in the **Eligible Authenticators** section of the Default Policy.
      a. If **Email** is set to **Disabled**, click **Edit** for the Default Policy.
      b. Select **Optional** from the dropdown list for the **Email** authenticator, and then click **Update Policy**.

### Set your app integration to use the email authenticator

New app integrations are automatically assigned the shared default [authentication policy](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-about-asop). This policy has a catch-all rule that allows a user access to the app using either one or two factors, depending on your org setup. In production, multiple app integrations can share the same application policy. In testing however, it's recommended that you create a new policy specifically for your test application.

1. Open the **Admin Console** for your org.
2. Choose **Security > Authentication Policies** to show the available authentication policies.
3. Click **Add a Policy**.
4. Give the policy a name, and then click **Save**.
5. Locate the Catch-all Rule of the new policy and select **Actions > Edit**.
6. Select **Allowed after successful authentication**.
7. Set **User must authenticate with** to **Password + Another factor**.
8. For **Possession factor constraints**:
   a. Verify that **Device Bound** isn't selected.
   b. Verify that **Email** is listed in the box under **Additional factor types**. If it isn't listed, verify that the authenticator is enabled using steps 4 and 5 of [Add the email authenticator to your org](#add-the-email-authenticator-to-your-org).
   c. Click **Save**.

9. Select the **Applications** tab for your newly created policy, and then click **Add App**.
10. Find your app in the list and click **Add** next to it.
11. Click **Close**.
12. Verify that the app is now listed in the **Applications** tab of the new policy.

### Set up magic links

Enable magic links in your org.

1. Open the **Admin Console** for your Okta org.
2. Choose **Applications > Applications** to show the app integrations that you have already created.
3. Click the application that you previously created.
4. In the **General Settings** section on the **General** tab, click **Edit**.
5. Under **EMAIL VERIFICATION EXPERIENCE** enter a callback URI for your application. The sample application uses <StackSnippet snippet="callbackuri" inline />.
6. Click **Save** to save your changes.

## Integrate email challenge with magic links

The following instructions detail integrating the email challenge into your app.

## Integrate different browser and device scenario with magic links

The Email Magic Links feature is designed with security in mind and only works when there is complete assurance that the person who started the request is the same one who clicked the magic link. For example, a user who started signing in to your app in a web browser must be in the same browser when they click the magic link. If the user's browser or device is different, the magic link is disabled, and they need to use OTP or return to the original browser to complete the email verification. The following flowchart illustrates this logic.

</div>

The following step-by-step instructions detail integrating the different browser scenario using the email challenge.

## Integrate email enrollment with OTP

 With a One-Time Passcode (OTP), the user copies an automatically generated numeric string from their email to your application to verify their identity. The following flowchart, which uses the sign-in with email example, illustrates the OTP user journey.

<div class="full">

![Flowchart showing the OTP flow](/img/authenticators/authenticators-email-overview-otp-flowchart.png)

</div>

The following instructions detail how to integrate the OTP flow for email enrollment. Even though this is an enrollment example, the OTP integration portion is nearly identical for the email challenge.

## Enable only OTP for the email authenticator

Magic links is a secure way to verify users' emails. However, you may want to use only OTP to provide an even higher level of security that positively proves that the person who started the request is the same person reading the email. In this case, OTP may be a more compatible solution. For example, if you have a banking app, which shows account information and allows for money transfers, magic links may be too convenient, and OTP may provide a better solution.

To disable magic link functionality, open the Admin Console and select **Customizations > Emails**. Now remove the links from the following email templates:

* Other > Email Challenge
* Other > Email Factor Verification
* Password > Forgot password

In each template, find the anchor tag and remove it from the template HTML. The following screenshot identifies the magic link anchor tag (identified by `email-authentication-button` id) for the **Email Challenge** template.

## Design considerations when customizing magic link for password recovery

### Design overview

If you customize your self-service password recovery (SSPR) solution as described in the <StackSnippet snippet="custompwdguide" inline /> and also initiate password recovery using the [/forgot_password API](/docs/reference/api/users/#forgot-password), you need to consider how your users interact with your magic links. Specifically, your design has the following attributes:

* The magic link `href` attribute in the **Forgot Password** template is updated to replace the `${resetPasswordLink}` variable with a URL string that contains the `otp` and `state` parameters using the `${oneTimePassword}` and `${request.relayState}` variables. For example, <StackSnippet snippet="callbackuriwithotpandstate" inline /> .

* Your system supports password recovery using methods other than self-service password recovery. These methods include calling the [/forgot_password API](/docs/reference/api/users/#forgot-password) with the `sendEmail` parameter sent to `true` or enabling password recoveries using the embedded Sign-In Widget. These methods send an email to the user with a magic link that is meant to continue the password recovery.

### Considerations

In this design, you customize the **Forgot Password** email template to include the `${oneTimePassword}` variable per the <StackSnippet snippet="custompwdguide" inline />.  When you use the [/forgot_password API](/docs/reference/api/users/#forgot-password) and Sign-In Widget are used to initiate the password recovery, an email is sent to the user. When the user clicks the magic link, and the request is redirected back to your app, the `otp` value is missing. This is because password recovery wasn't initiated by the embedded SDK and doesn't have context. Since the `otp` value is missing, your app can't complete the password reset using the embedded SDK. Two options are available, however, to complete the password reset with this design.

#### Option 1: Use the `resetPasswordLink` variable

In this option, you set the magic link in the **Forgot Password** template to use the `${resetPasswordLink}` variable or include logic that sets it to `${resetPasswordLink}` if `${oneTimePassword}` is empty.

<StackSnippet snippet="magiclinkcallback" />

> **Note:** Using `${resetPasswordLink}` sends the user to an Okta-hosted page to sign in. If you're looking for a fully branded experience where you control the page experience, then the next option is a better alternative.

#### Option 2 (Recommended): Use your own infrastructure to send the password recovery email

In this option, make a call to [/forgot_password API](/docs/reference/api/users/#forgot-password) and use your infrastructure to notify the user to reset their password.

1. Call [/forgot_password API](/docs/reference/api/users/#forgot-password) with `sendEmail=false`. Instead of sending a recovery email to the user, this returns a URL with a recovery token.

```json
{
  "resetPasswordUrl": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/signin/reset-password/XE6wE17zmphl3KqAPFxO"
}
```

In the above example, the recovery token is `XE6wE17zmphl3KqAPFxO`.

2. Parse the recovery token from the URL and send it using your infrastructure (through an out-of-band channel) to the end user's verified email address or SMS phone number. See [Authentication API - Recovery Token](/docs/reference/api/authn/#recovery-token).
