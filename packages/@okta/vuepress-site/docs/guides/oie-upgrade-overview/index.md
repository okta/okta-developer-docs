To leverage the power of [Okta Identity Engine](/docs/guides/oie-intro/#about-okta-identity-engine) and to easily adopt new features, migrate your existing orgs from Classic Engine onto Identity Engine. Upgrading to Identity Engine allows you to implement many new capabilities in Okta's access management products and provides more flexibility to manage your user authentication. This document provides an overview of the upgrade process for customer identity & developer use cases.

<!-- Are you an admin? See the [Identity Engine Upgrade Overview](link to product doc upgrade overview) for admins.-->

## Prerequisites

* [Upgrade your Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-sign-in-widget/) before reading this document or requesting a data upgrade. Anyone using the Sign-In Widget should upgrade to the latest version (either Okta-hosted using our redirect model or embedding a form of the Widget inside your applications).
* Complete the initial org upgrade process. If you haven't yet migrated your orgs from Classic Engine to Identity Engine, discuss your options with your Okta account team.

## Upgrade Process

The initial upgrade path consists of the following steps:

* Complete data migration
* Convert and migrate objects such as policies, orgs, and users
* Turn on Identity Engine for the entire org

At the end of the data migration, your auth experience may continue to mimic Classic Engine, but your admin experience changes and all of the Okta objects from Classic Engine are now compatible with Identity Engine.

> **Note:** For an overview of the changes in the Admin Console, see [Compare Identity Engine and Classic Engine](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-oie-whats-new).

The rest of the upgrade process is defined in the next section. Which steps that you take are related to your deployment model. We have carefully considered how you can break up the upgrade steps to ensure that you maintain the best user experience across your applications. We don’t recommend doing this upgrade all at once, but rather in sections with breaks for testing. This process is designed to be non-disruptive and iterative over a period of time. Make the upgrade steps part of your normal product development process.

## Upgrade Steps

After you complete the prerequisites, your data migration is finished, and you have access to your Identity Engine org, the following content outlines the next steps that you may take as you navigate through the rest of your upgrade process.

For a more detailed look at the upgrade steps, see the [Planning embedded auth application upgrades](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-planning-embedded-upgrades) guide.

1. Test your new environment to make sure that your experience and functionality are preserved.
2. What’s your Deployment Model?

    **Are you redirecting to the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget?**

    * Test your user experience.

    * Make any necessary [updates to the Sign-In Widget styling](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-sign-in-widget-styling/) and [i18n properties](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-sign-in-widget-i18n/).

    * Check your `config.idps` [settings](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#openid-connect) for customizations that may not be compatible with Identity Engine.

    > **Note:** See the **Remember me** section of the [Compare Identity Engine and Classic Engine](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-oie-whats-new) for more information on functionality changes in the Admin Console.

    **Are you embedding our Sign-In Widget?**

    * Test your user experience.

    * Make any necessary [updates to the Sign-In Widget styling](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-sign-in-widget-styling/) and [i18n properties](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-sign-in-widget-i18n/).

    **Are you embedding your authentication with our SDKs?**

    * Add the appropriate Identity Engine SDK to your application code or update to the latest version of the Identity Engine SDK. See [Add the latest Auth SDKs to your applications](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-add-sdk-to-your-app/nodejs/main/) for detailed steps by language. <!-- (/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-add-sdk-to-your-app/-/main/) -->

    **Are you moving to an architecture that leverages an Okta SDK?** More detailed information coming soon. <!-- See [Move away from using Authn APIs to using the appropriate SDK](/docs/guides/) for details on this task. -->

3. Test your user experience.

    * **Authentication:** Make sure that your users can sign in and sign out for the workflows that you support.

    * **Self-Service Password Recovery:** Make sure that users can recover their factors with no blockers.

    * **Self-Service Registration:** Make sure that users can sign up (including Factor enrollment if you support that) and that there are no interruptions during that process.

  See [Upgrade your application to use the Identity Engine SDK](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-api-sdk-to-oie-sdk/nodejs/main/) for detailed steps by language. <!-- (/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-api-sdk-to-oie-sdk/-/main/) -->
