title: Basic sign-in flow using the password factor
---

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

> **Note:** A request context for the browser client is required when a server-side web application uses an embedded SDK as a proxy between itself and Okta. This context contains values (geolocation, IP address, and user agent) that inform a secure response. However, these values are currently taken from the server rather than the client. As a result, network zones and behaviors that drive their conditions based on these request context values donâ€™t currently work.

Enable a password-only sign-in flow in your application using an Embedded SDK.
