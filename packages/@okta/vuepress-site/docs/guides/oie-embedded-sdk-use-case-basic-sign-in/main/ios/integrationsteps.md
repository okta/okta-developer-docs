### Sample application and SDK integration

Similar to the Okta APIs, the SDK uses a generic interface to handle
each step of the user sign-in flow. This interface enables applications
to use a dynamic model when responding to policy changes within Okta. Specifically,
it enables a pure policy-driven design that accepts new functionality,
such as adding additional sign-in factors, without the need to update your
application's code. This feature is important for mobile devices due to the challenges in updating applications. See how the [sample application](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-run-samples/ios/main/) uses the SDK to implement this dynamic policy-driven behavior.

### Integrate the SDK with the sample code

In contrast to the sample application, the
[sample code](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-swift/tree/master/Samples/Signin%20Samples)
provided in this step-by-step guide wraps the SDK with a more prescriptive and explicit interface
that is purposely built to help facilitate understanding of how to use the SDK.
It's meant to be a learning tool and although you can implement similar code in your
app, you're advised to use the same best practice dynamic approach implemented
in the sample application.

The following steps document how to integrate the sample code into your
application. The sample code converts the SDK's generic remediation
interface into explicit authentication steps and automatically executes steps,
such as the code-to-token exchange. The following diagram illustrates this call flow
from your applications's UI to the sample code, SDK, and API.

> **Note:** The Integrating code component represents the code that you write to call the sample code's interface.

### 1: Launch the app and initialize the SDK

The first step is to initialize the SDK when the user opens your app.
This is done by creating an instance of `BasicLogin` and passing into
its initializer a `configuration` object.

 ```swift
self.authHandler = BasicLogin(configuration: configuration)
```

For more information on how to set the configuration parameters, see [SDK](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/ios/main/#sdk)
in
[Download and set up the SDK, Sign-In Widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/ios/main).

### 2: The user initiates the sign-in flow

When the user enters their credentials and initiates the sign-in flow,
call the `login` method, passing in the username, password,
and `completion` closure. This closure is invoked after the sign-in process completes
and returns either a fatal error or a success status with a token.

```swift
 self.authHandler.login(username: "user@example.com",
                       password: "secretPassword")
{ result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let token):
        print(token)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

### 3: Send the user to the home page after a successful sign-in flow

The final integration step is to send the user to the default home page
after a successful sign-in flow. Optionally, you can obtain basic user information after the user
successfully signs in by making a request to the Okta OpenID Connect Authorization Server.
See [Get the user profile information](#get-the-user-profile-information).

#### Sample code

The following sample code is also located in Okta's
[okta-idx-swift repository](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-swift/blob/master/Samples/Signin%20Samples/BasicLogin.swift).

```swift
public class BasicLogin {
    let configuration: IDXClient.Configuration
    var username: String?
    var password: String?

    var client: IDXClient?
    var completion: ((Result<IDXClient.Token, LoginError>) -> Void)?

    public init(configuration: IDXClient.Configuration) {
        self.configuration = configuration
    }

    // Public method that initiates the login flow.
    public func login(username: String, password: String, completion: @escaping (Result<IDXClient.Token, LoginError>) -> Void) {
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.completion = completion

        // Initiates the creation of an IDX client.
        IDXClient.start(with: configuration) { (client, error) in
            guard let client = client else {
                self.finish(with: error)
                return
            }

            self.client = client

            // Assign ourselves as the delegate receiver, to be notified
            // when responses or errors are returned.
            client.delegate = self

            // Calls the IDX API to receive the first IDX response.
            client.resume(completion: nil)
        }
    }

    public enum LoginError: Error {
        case error(_ error: Error)
        case message(_ string: String)
        case cannotProceed

    // Delegate method sent when a token is successfully exchanged.
    public func idx(client: IDXClient, didReceive token: IDXClient.Token) {
        finish(with: token)

    // of what action or remediation is called.

            response.exchangeCode(completion: nil)
            return
        }

        // If no remediations are present, abort the login process.
        guard let remediation = response.remediations.first else {

        // Handle the various remediation choices the client may be presented with within this policy.
        switch remediation.type {
        case .identify:
            remediation.identifier?.value = username
            remediation.credentials?.passcode?.value = password
            remediation.proceed(completion: nil)

        // In identify-first policies, the password is supplied on a separate response.
        case .challengeAuthenticator:
            guard remediation.authenticators.first?.type == .password else {
                finish(with: .unexpectedAuthenticator)
                return
            }

            remediation.credentials?.passcode?.value = password
            remediation.proceed(completion: nil)

        default:
            finish(with: .cannotProceed)
        }
    }
}

// Utility functions to help return responses to the caller.
extension BasicLogin {
    func finish(with error: Error?) {
