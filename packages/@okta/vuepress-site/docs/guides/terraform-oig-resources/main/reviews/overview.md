Okta access certification reviews evaluate and make decisions about a user’s current resource access. Each review is associated with one campaign, whereas a campaign can contain many reviews. For more information on the review process, see [Review an access certification campaign](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=iga-ac-about-reviewing-campaigns.htm) and [Reviews API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Reviews/).
