**Note**: Ensure that you have the campaign ID to import an existing campaign object into Terraform. You can retrieve this ID in either the Admin Console or using the [Campaigns API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Campaigns/).

```shell

terraform import okta_campaign.example <campaign_id>

```
