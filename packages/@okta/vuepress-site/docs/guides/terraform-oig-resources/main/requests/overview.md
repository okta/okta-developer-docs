Okta Access Requests automate the process of requesting access to resources managed by access request conditions.

Access request conditions define the resource to access, who can request access, length of access, and the approval sequence. For more information see [Access Requests ](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-governance/access-requests/ar-overview.htm) and [Requests API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Requests/#tag/Requests).
