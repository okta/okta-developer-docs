## Single Sign-On: Building an Integration with Okta

Your application needs to support Federated Single Sign-On, a common approach for an application to rely on an external identity provider. For web-based applications, [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) is the standard. For mobile applications, many mobile solution vendors offer proprietary SDKs to provide support. Okta offers [Okta Mobile Connect](/docs/guides/okta_mobile_connect) which is based on the SAML protocol.

For details on how to federate your application with SAML and Okta Mobile Connect, go to our [Single Sign-On with Okta](/docs/guides/saml_guidance) section for additional guidance.

Use the following instructions to support single sign-on for your app in the public-facing Okta Integration Network:
