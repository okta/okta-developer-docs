## What integrations can I build?

### Enable Single Sign-On

<span style="width: 36px;display:inline-block">![SSO](/img/customLanding/features-1.svg)</span> Let users securely sign in to your app with their credentials.

<a href='/docs/guides/oin-sso-overview/' class='Button--blueDarkOutline' data-proofer-ignore><span>Get started with Single Sign-On</span></a>

Build this if you want to:

* Streamline the sign-in flow
* Use Okta for identity management and secure access
* Federate using [OIDC](/docs/guides/oin-oidc-overview/main/) or [SAML](/docs/concepts/saml/)

### Automate the user lifecycle

<span style="width: 36px;display:inline-block">![LCM](/img/customLanding/features-2.svg)</span> Automatically provision, update, and deprovision users securely with SCIM and automate complex actions with our low code/no-code building tools.

<a href='/docs/guides/oin-lifecycle-mgmt-overview/' class='Button--blueDarkOutline' data-proofer-ignore><span>Get started with the user lifecycle</span></a>

Build this if you want to:

* Synchronize your app user profiles with Okta profiles
* Use [SCIM](/docs/concepts/scim/) to manage users in cloud-based systems
* Provide custom onboarding and offboarding flows with [Workflows Connector Builder](https://help.okta.com/wf/en-us/Content/Topics/Workflows/connector-builder/connector-builder.htm)

### Secure API service applications

<span style="width: 36px;display:inline-block">![API](/img/customLanding/features-2.svg)</span> Secure your API service applications with Okta using OAuth 2.0.

<a href='/docs/guides/oin-api-service-overview/' class='Button--blueDarkOutline' data-proofer-ignore><span>Get started with API service integrations</span></a>

Build this if you want to:

* support your customers with app access to Okta APIs
* access Okta APIs without user association (service-to-service implementation)

### Risk signal sharing

<span style="width: 36px;display:inline-block">![Risk](/img/customLanding/features-3.svg)</span> Connect to Okta's risk APIs to share risk signals and make it easier for your customers to protect their users and data.

Build this if you want to:

* [Use the Risk Signal API](/docs/guides/third-party-risk-integration/) to unite risk signals with access decisions and secure digital experiences
* Enhance security efficacy against targeted identity attacks
