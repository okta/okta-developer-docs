The Resource Owner Password Flow is intended for use cases where you control both the client application and the resource that it is interacting with. At a high-level, this flow has the following steps:

- Your client application collects a user's credentials.
- Your application sends these credentials to your Okta authorization server.
- If the credentials are accurate, Okta responds with the requested tokens.

For more information on the resource owner password flow, including why to use it, see [our OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/concepts/auth-overview/#resource-owner-password-flow).
