* An existing SAML 2.0 third-party identity provider (IdP) that's able to send AMR claims to Okta. See [Create an external identity provider](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/saml2/main/).
* The third-party IdP configured in Okta. See [Create an identity provider in Okta](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/saml2/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). This connects your Okta org to the IdP.
