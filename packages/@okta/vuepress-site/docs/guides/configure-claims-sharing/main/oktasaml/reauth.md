## Reauthentication

Okta claims sharing doesn't currently support reauthentication. The user isn’t prompted for reauthentication as long as the session is active.

Also, when you federate from the IdP org to the SP org’s Okta dashboard and then click **Admin**, you aren't prompted for reauthentication. The factors from the IdP are valid until the end of the session on the SP org.
