When you use SAML 2.0 with claims sharing, the data shared between an Okta IdP and an Okta SP is included in the SAML response in a new reserved tag in the `Extension` section called `OktaAuth`. This content is communicated in JSON within the `Assertion` response and contains information about authentication performed at the Okta IdP org. The entire assertion is securely encrypted with a published encryption key from the SP org.
