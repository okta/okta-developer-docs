When you use SAML 2.0 with claims sharing, the data shared between an Okta IdP and an Okta SP is included in the SAML response in a new reserved tag in the `Extension` section called `OktaAuth`. The content is communicated in a JSON Web Token embedded within the `Assertion` response. The Okta authentication JWT payload is securely encrypted with a published encryption key from the SP org. The payload contains information about authentication performed at the Okta IdP org.
