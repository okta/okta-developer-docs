When you use OpenID Connect with claims sharing, the data shared between an Okta IdP and an Okta SP is included in the ID token under a new reserved claim name called `okta_auth`. The `okta_auth` payload is communicated in JSON within the ID token response and contains information about authentication performed at the Okta IdP org.
