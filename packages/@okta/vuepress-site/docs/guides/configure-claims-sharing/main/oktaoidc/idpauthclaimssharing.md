When you use OpenID Connect with claims sharing, the data that's shared between an Okta IdP and an Okta SP is included in the ID token under a new reserved claim name called `okta_auth`. The `okta_auth` payload within the ID token response contains information about authentication performed at the Okta IdP org.
