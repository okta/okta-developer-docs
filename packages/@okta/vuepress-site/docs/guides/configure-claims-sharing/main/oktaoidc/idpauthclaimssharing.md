When you use OpenID Connect with claims sharing, the data shared between an Okta IdP and an Okta SP is included in the ID token under a new reserved claim name called `okta-auth`. The `okta_auth` payload is in JWT format within the ID token. The Okta authentication JWT payload is securely encrypted with a published encryption key from the SP org. The payload contains information about authentication performed at the Okta IdP org.
