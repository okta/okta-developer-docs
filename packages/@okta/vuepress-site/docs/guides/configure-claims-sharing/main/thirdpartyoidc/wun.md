* An existing OpenID Connect (OIDC) third-party identity provider (IdP) that's able to send AMR claims to Okta. See <StackSnippet snippet="addanidp" inline />.
* The third-party IdP configured in Okta. See [Create an identity provider in Okta](/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/main/#create-an-identity-provider-in-okta). This connects your Okta org to the IdP.
* The **Third-party IdP claims sharing** feature enabled in your Okta org. Go to **Settings | Features**, locate the feature, and then enable it.
* If you don't have an Okta org, you can create an [Okta Developer Edition org](https://developer.okta.com/signup).
