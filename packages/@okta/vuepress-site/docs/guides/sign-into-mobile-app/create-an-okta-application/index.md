title: Create an Okta Application
---
Before your code can redirect to Okta to sign a user in, you need to create an Okta Application that represents your mobile application.

First, sign in to the Okta Developer Console:

<a href="https://login.okta.com/" target="_blank" class="Button--blue">Go to Console</a>

1. Select **Applications**, then **Add Application**. Pick **Native** as the platform. Enter a name for your application (or leave the default value).

2. Enter values for the **Login redirect URI**. This is the callback route you created in the [previous step](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/define-callback). You should add values for local development (such as `http://localhost:8080/implicit/callback`) and production (such as `https://app.example.com/implicit/callback`/).

3. Finally, click **Done** to finish creating the Okta Application. You need to copy some values into your application later, so leave the Developer Console open.
