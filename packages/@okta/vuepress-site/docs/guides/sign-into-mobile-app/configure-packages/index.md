Next you need to add Okta to your application by installing our SDK.

### Install the SDK

<StackSelector snippet="installsdk"/>

### Configure the SDK

You need the following values from the Okta Application and the Developer Console that you worked with in <GuideLink link="../create-okta-application">Create an okta application</GuideLink>:

* **Client ID** &mdash; Find it in the applications list or on the application's **General** tab.
* **Okta Domain** &mdash; Find it on the Developer Console dashboard in the upper-right corner as the **Org URL**.

> **Note:** Your Okta domain is different from your admin domain. Don't include `-admin` in your Okta domain.

You'll also need the full redirect URI that you defined in <GuideLink link="../define-callback">Define a callback route</GuideLink>.
