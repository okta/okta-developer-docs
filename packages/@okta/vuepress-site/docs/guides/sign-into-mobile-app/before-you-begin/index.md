title: Before you begin
---
This guide shows you how to use Okta as the user store for your mobile application. When you've finished following the steps, your app opens a browser to sign users in.

If you are building a web application, see [Sign users in to your web application](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/) or [Sign users in to your single-page application](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/) instead.

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).
* Know the basics of building mobile apps.
* Have a project or app that you want to add authentication to.
