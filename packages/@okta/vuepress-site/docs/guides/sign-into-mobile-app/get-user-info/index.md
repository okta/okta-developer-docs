title: Get Info About the User
---
When a user signs in, their profile information (stored in Okta) is made available to your application. It's common to use this info to update your app's UI.

By default, the profile items (called "claims") that Okta returns include the user's email address, first name, and last name.

<!-- You can also customize the items (called claims) that are returned from Okta. See [Token customization guide]. -->
