Okta Identity Engine introduces a lot of changes to the Okta platform. Some of these changes result in a lack of support for previously available features. Additionally, some of these changes result in Identity Engine features not supported for use with Classic Engine APIs.

Are you an admin? See the Identity Engine [limitations](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-oie-limitations) doc for admins.

> **Note:** This doc is designed for people who are familiar with Classic Engine. If you are new to Okta and Identity Engine, see [Get started](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-get-started-oie) with Identity Engine.

## Classic Engine features not supported in Identity Engine

### Custom sign-in page for embedded app links

**What Changed:** Using a custom sign-in page for embedded app links isn't supported. Users who click an app embed link are now evaluated by their org's Okta sign-on policy. Admins can customize an Okta-hosted sign-on page or configure an IdP routing rule for the app.

**Further information:** [Configure a custom Okta-hosted sign-on page](/docs/guides/custom-widget/) and [Configure routing rules](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext_Identity_Provider_Discovery)

### Event Type availability for event hooks

**What Changed:** The following Event Types aren't available in Identity Engine because Device Trust isn't currently supported:

* `user.authentication.authenticate`
* `user.credential.enroll`

The following Event Type isn’t available in Identity Engine because it's no longer being triggered:

`user.account.unlock_token`

The following Event Types are available only in Identity Engine and can't be used by Classic Engine customers:

* `device.enrollment.create`
* `user.mfa.factor.suspend`
* `user.mfa.factor.unsuspend`
* `security.authenticator.lifecycle.activated`
* `security.authenticator.lifecycle.deactivate`

**Further Information:** [Event Types](/docs/reference/api/event-types/)

***

### Target.ID value simulated for mobile phone event types

**What Changed:** `Target.ID` represents a simulated value for the following event types:

* `system.voice.send_phone_verification_call`
* `system.sms.send_phone_verification_message`

Specifically, when `Target.Type` equals `MobilePhone` for these events, `Target.ID` has no intrinsic value other than being a placeholder that allows backward compatibility with Classic Engine. In Classic Engine, `Target.ID` is unique per phone number, stored in Okta's backend systems, and can be used to link all events for a given phone number. The following example from the System Log API shows these fields:

```json
  "target": [
    {
      "id": "qFGtyCw3hwhHh55555555z",
      "type": "MobilePhone",
      "alternateId": "+15555555555",
      "displayName": "+15555555555",
      "detailEntry": null
    }
  ]
```

If you use the `Target.Id` to link and reconcile events in Classic, use the phone number in Identity Engine. The phone number is found in `Target.AlternateId`.

**Further Information:**

* [System Log](/docs/reference/api/system-log/)
* [Event Types](/docs/reference/api/event-types/)

### Help Support number

**What Changed:** In Identity Engine, if the user is unable to use an Authenticator, the Help Support number is no longer provided. The only support available is the Authenticator list page that provides alternative ways for the user to authenticate.

***

### Personal identity verification

**What Changed:** Not supported

**Further Information:** [Learn more about PIV](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-idp-smart-card-workflow)

***

### Reset Factor API - email enrollment

**What Changed:** With Identity Engine, a user’s verified `primaryEmail` is considered an email (Authenticator) enrollment for the user. Therefore, the GET `/factors` API always returns the verified `primaryEmail` as an active email factor.

The use of the Classic Engine Reset Factor API for resetting a user’s email enrollment is discouraged and considered moot, because email is an auto-enrolling Authenticator in Identity Engine. A user’s verified `primaryEmail` is always usable as long as the Email Authenticator is set to `ACTIVE`, and the user can use it for **recovery only** or for both **authentication and recovery**, depending on the Email Authenticator settings.

***

### Reset Factor API - question enrollment

**What Changed:** Identity Engine steers away from the notion of separate questions for MFA and Recovery. Therefore, the GET `/factors` API now returns the Recovery Question (Forgot Password Question) in the absence of an MFA Security Question enrollment for the user.

In Classic Engine, when a user is using both the Forgot Password Question and a Security Question for MFA, and an API call is made to `v1/lifecycle/reset_factors` to reset all the factors for the user, only the Security Question is reset. And then, if the GET `/factors` API is called, the Forgot Password Question isn't returned as a factor. With an upgrade to Identity Engine, after resetting all the factors, when the GET `/factors` API is then called, the Forgot Password Question is returned as a factor in the response.

> **Note:** With Identity Engine, if a user is using both the Forgot Password Question and a Security Question for MFA, and an API call is made to `v1/lifecycle/reset_factors` to reset all the factors for the user, just the Security Question is reset with that call. To reset the Forgot Password Question after that first call, make a second call to `/v1/lifecycle/reset_factors`.

***

### Self-Service Registration

**What Changed:** The Self-Service Registration feature isn't supported. Self-service registration is now accomplished through a profile enrollment policy. In a profile enrollment policy, admins select the attributes they want to collect when a new end user clicks **Sign up**. After the end user is authenticated into the app, their profile is complete and they are provisioned to the appropriate groups.

**Further information:** [Manage Profile Enrollment policies](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-profile-enrollment)

***

### Sessions APIs

**What Changed:** Some Sessions APIs aren't supported in Identity Engine. However, your existing application could continue to work as long as session management and application interactions are fully contained within the `v1/sessions` APIs.

**Further Information:** APIs not supported in Identity Engine sessions:

* `GET /api/v1/sessions/${sessionId}`
* `POST /api/v1/sessions/${sessionId}/lifecycle/refresh`
* `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/${sessionId}`
* `POST /api/v1/users/me/lifecycle/delete_sessions`

***

### Session Token created before an Identity Engine upgrade prompts user for password after upgrade completes

**What Changed:** If a user authenticates in Classic Engine (which creates a `sessionToken`), and the upgrade to Identity Engine completes during the time that the `sessionToken` is valid (five minutes), then when a user attempts to access an OpenID Connect app after the upgrade, the user is prompted for their password again.

> **Note:** This scenario only happens during an upgrade from Classic Engine to Identity Engine. It doesn't continue to happen after the upgrade.

***

### SMS Factors Administration lifecycle operations

**What Changed:** The SMS Factor can no longer be activated or deactivated using the Factors Administrator API (`/api/v1/org/factors`).

**Further Information:** [Factors Administration API](/docs/reference/api/factor-admin)

***

### The `audience` parameter in the Authentication API

**What Changed:** Passing the `audience` parameter to the `/api/v1/authn` API isn't supported in Identity Engine because of the new flexible authentication policy that comes with Identity Engine. The Classic Engine pipeline doesn't support the flexible authentication policy.

**Further information:** [IdP-initiated step-up authentication](/docs/reference/api/authn/#idp-initiated-step-up-authentication)

***

## Identity Engine features not supported with Classic Engine APIs

### Factor API enrollment limitations

The following Identity Engine features aren't supported using the Factor APIs.

* Enroll in multiple Okta Verify factors using the [Factors API](/docs/reference/api/factors/#enroll-okta-verify-totp-factor). You can only use the Factors API to enroll the first Okta Verify factor.
* Okta Verify authenticator settings aren't enforced when enrolling using the Factors API:

  * The FIPS compliance requirement for enrollments
  * The User Verification requirement for enrollments
  * New Okta Verify enrollments that are created with the Factors API aren't mapped to a device.
  * WebAuthN authenticator User Verification settings aren't enforced when enrolling using the Factors API.

See the [SDK uses cases](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/main/) in our Embedded SDK guides for more information on profile enrollment.

***

### Password recovery limitations with the /authn API

Developers who use the `/api/v1/authn` APIs to build custom password reset and account unlock experiences can't use the new recovery options in Identity Engine. Specifically, if developers set a password policy rule to require Okta Verify Push for recovery or configure **Any enrolled authenticator used for MFA/SSO** for additional verification, end users who use the Classic Engine Authentication APIs are denied recovery.

**Further information:** [Recovery operations](/docs/reference/api/authn/#recovery-operations) section of the Authentication API.

## Okta Sign-In Widget upgrade

For Identity Engine, some specific objects that were previously in the widget configuration are no longer supported and must be removed. Also, specific feature flags aren't supported when you upgrade the widget and must be removed from `features` in the JSON code. See [Upgrade your Okta Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-sign-in-widget/main/) for a comprehensive list of configuration and feature changes.
