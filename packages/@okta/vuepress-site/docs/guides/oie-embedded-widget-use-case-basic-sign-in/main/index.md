title: Basic sign-in flow using the widget
---

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

Enable a password-only sign-in flow in your web app using the embedded Sign-In Widget.

> **Note**: Passwords are a security vulnerability because they can be easily stolen and are prone to phishing attacks. Give your users the ability to use other authenticators by replacing password-only sign-in experiences with either a [password-optional](/docs/guides/pwd-optional-overview) or a multifactor experience.
