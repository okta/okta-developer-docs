title: Set-up Postman
---

If you haven't set up Postman already, you will need to do that
now. Here are [instructions for setting up Postman to work with Okta](/code/rest/).

### Test Postman

Before you get started, you will want to make sure your Postman
setup is configured correctly, a "[Hello World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)" of sorts. Test your
Postman setup as follows:

1.  Open Postman.
2.  Open the "Collections" section in Postman.
3.  Select the "Users (Okta API)" collection.
4.  Scroll until you see the "GET List Users" request template.
5.  Select the "GET List Users" request template.
6.  Click the blue "Send" button.

You'll know it is working if you get back JSON containing one or more user objects.
