title: Test the Postman setup
---
Make sure that your Postman setup is configured correctly:

> **Note:** If you don't already have Postman set up, follow these instructions to [set up Postman](/code/rest/) to work with Okta. There is also a dedicated page with all of our [Postman collections](/docs/reference/postman-collections/).

1. In Postman, select the **Collections** tab on the left.
2. Select the **Users (Okta API)** collection and then the **List Users** folder.
3. Scroll to the **List Users** folder and select the **List Users** request template. The request appears on the right.
4. Click **Send**. A successful request results in an HTTP status code of `200` and a JSON payload response with the Users associated with your org.
