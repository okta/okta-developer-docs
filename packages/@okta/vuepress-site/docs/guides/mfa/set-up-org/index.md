title: Set up your Okta org for MFA
---

Before you begin, make sure to enable support for MFA in the Admin Console of your Okta org.

## Enable MFA in your Okta org

You need to enable MFA from the Admin Console of your Okta org before you can use it with the Okta API. In this example, we are going to enable the **Google Authenticator** MFA factor type.

1. From the Admin Console, select **Security** and then **Multifactor**.
2. On the **Factor Types** tab, select **Google Authenticator**.
3. Click the drop-down list for **Google Authenticator** and select **Activate**.

    > **Note:** See [MFA](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/MFA.htm) and [Security Policies](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/Security_Policies.htm) for more information about MFA and the Okta org.
