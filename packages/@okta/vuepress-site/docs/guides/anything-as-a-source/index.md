This guide outlines how to develop a custom client to manage an identity source with Okta for the Anything-as-a-Source (XaaS) integration. The custom client can be a standalone app or a component of an existing app. The client drives the synchronization between the HR source (the identity source) and Universal Directory.

## Overview

The Okta Anything-as-a-Source (XaaS) integration provides your org with the ability to source identities from any HR source to your Okta org. The HR source acts as a source of truth. Users and groups are pushed and mapped to Okta user and group profiles in the Okta Universal Directory. There are two methods to implement the XaaS integration:

* Using Okta Workflows
* Developing a custom client

With either method, you need to first define your HR source in your Okta org. This is referred to as the Custom Identity Source integration. Okta provides a Custom Identity Source unique identifier that you can use in your Okta Workflow or custom client to identify the HR source. See Create and configure a Custom Identity Source in [Use Anything-as-a-Source](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-use-xaas).

This guide outlines the Identity Sources API flow, so you can develop your custom client for the XaaS integration. For XaaS integrations using [Okta Workflows](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=wf), see Okta connector action cards for bulk user import and identity-source session management.

## Identity Sources API concepts

### Identity source session

The Identity Sources API synchronizing data flow uses an [identity source session](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/getIdentitySourceSession!c=200&path=id&t=response) object to encapsulate the data upload and the data import processing tasks. Create an identity source session object each time that you want to synchronize data from the HR source to Okta. The identity source session object uses the following `status` values to indicate each stage of the synchronization process flow.

### Identity source session status

* **CREATED**: The identity source session object has been created for a specific Custom Identity Source integration. You can load data to the session at this stage. Data import processing hasn't been invoked, and you can cancel the session at this stage.
* **IN_PROGRESS**: The data for the identity source session is being uploaded in the identity source session.
* **TRIGGERED**: Okta is processing the uploaded data in the identity source session. You can't load new data to the identity source session object at this stage, and you can't cancel the session. You can view sessions with this status on the [Import Monitoring](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-view-import-monitoring-dashboard) page in the Admin Console.
* **COMPLETED**: Okta has processed the data in the identity source session object. You can't upload new data to the identity source session object if it has this status, because the synchronization data job is considered complete.
* **CLOSED**: The session is canceled and isn't available for further activity. You can only cancel identity source sessions with the `CREATED` or `IN_PROGRESS` status. You can't cancel a session that has been triggered or completed. Previously loaded data is deleted from a canceled identity source session.
* **EXPIRED**: This status indicates that the identity source session has timed out during the data loading stage. An identity source session with the `CREATED` or `IN_PROGRESS` status expires after 24 hours of inactivity.
* **ERROR**: This status indicates that there was an error while upserting or deleting entities from the entity database.

### Identity source session process

You can only process one identity source session at a time (for a specific Custom Identity Source integration) to avoid conflicts. The following are more identity source session behaviors:

* You can only load data to an identity source session when it's in the `CREATED` status.
* There can only be one identity source session in the `CREATED` status for an identity source.
* Only sessions that are in the `IN_PROGRESS` status can be triggered to start an import request.
* An identity source session with the `CREATED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `TRIGGERED` status is considered active.
* If there are no API requests in 24 hours for an identity source session that has the `CREATED` status, then the status is set to `EXPIRED` and the session can no longer be used.
* Okta processes the sessions synchronously (not in parallel) for an identity source. If you trigger multiple sessions for an identity source, then the sessions are queued up for sequential processing.

Errors are thrown in the following situations:

* You can't create an identity source session within five minutes of triggering an active session associated with the same identity source. If Okta receives a new identity source session request within five minutes of an active identity source session with the `CREATED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or the `TRIGGERED` status, Okta returns a 400 Bad Request response.
* If you try to do a bulk delete with a non-existent `externalId` or a bulk upsert with an empty or `null` payload, the session status won't move to `IN_PROGRESS`, but remain in a `CREATED` state. If you try to trigger a session still in a `CREATED` state, an error is thrown.

> **Note:** You can use the [List all identity source sessions](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/listIdentitySourceSessions) request to return active identity source sessions for an identity source.

### Bulk-load requests

Bulk-load requests contain the data that you want changed. The data can be different entities. Okta currently supports the following entity types: users, groups, or group memberships. See [Identity source data](#identity-source-data).

There are two types of bulk-load requests:

* **Bulk addition**: Insert or update entities in the bulk-load request.
* **Bulk deletion**: Deactivate the entities in the bulk-load request.

The bulk-load request payload contains an array of external identity source objects. The items in the objects vary depending on the request that you're making.

After you make a bulk-load request, the identity source session transitions from `CREATED` to `IN_PROGRESS` status.

You can load up to 200 KB of data or up to 200 entities in a single bulk-load request for an identity source session. To load more data, make multiple bulk-load requests to the same session. The maximum number of requests for a session is 50.

Create another identity source session object when you exhaust the maximum number of bulk-load requests and need to load more data. Keep in mind that you can only load data to an identity source session with the `CREATED` status.

> **Note:** Only `"importType": "INCREMENTAL"` is supported for an identity source session.

### Identity source data

You can load data about different entities to be added, changed, or deleted in Okta. The entities currently supported are [users](#user-data), [groups](#group-data), and [group memberships](#group-memberships-data).

#### User data

To load bulk users data, use `profiles`. The user `profiles` object is an array of user `profile` objects that contain attributes about the user.

Each user object in the `profiles` array can contain the following:

* `externalId`: The unique identifier from the HR source and is assumed to be immutable (never updated for a specific user). This determines if the API needs to create a new user or update an existing user.
* `profile`: The set of attributes from the HR source to synchronize with the Okta user profile. Profiles are mapped according to the attribute mappings that you specified in your Custom Identity Source configuration. See Declare an identity source schema in [Use Anything-as-a-Source](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-use-xaas).
    > **Note:** All attributes in a `profile` object are treated as strings. Arrays arenâ€™t supported.

Use the following endpoints to bulk load users. Each endpoint also lists example payload requests and response bodies:

* [Upload the data to be upserted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceDataForUpsert)
* [Upload the data to be deleted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceDataForDelete)

#### Group data

To load bulk groups data, use `profiles`. The group `profiles` object is an array of pairs, with each pair listing the group's external ID and the group's `profile` that contain attributes about the group, but no membership data.

Each group object in the `profiles` array can contain the following:

* `externalId`: The unique identifier from the HR source and is assumed to be immutable (never updated for a specific group). This determines if the API needs to create a new group or update an existing group.
* `profile`: The set of attributes from the HR source to synchronize with the Okta group profile. Profiles are mapped according to the attribute mappings that you specified in your Custom Identity Source configuration. See Declare an identity source schema in [Use Anything-as-a-Source](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-use-xaas).
    > **Note:** All attributes in a `profile` object are treated as strings. Arrays arenâ€™t supported.

Use the following endpoints to bulk load groups. Each endpoint also lists example payload requests and response bodies:

* [Upload the group profiles without memberships to be upserted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupsForUpsert)
* [Upload the group external IDs to be deleted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupsDataForDelete)

#### Group memberships data

To load bulk group membership information, use `memberships`. The group `memberships` object is an array of pairs, with each pair listing the group's external ID and an array of member IDs in that group.

Each group object in the `memberships` array contains the following:

* `externalId`: The unique identifier from the HR source and is assumed to be immutable (never updated for a specific group). Add the memberships to this group external ID.
* `memberExternalIds`: An array of external membership IDs for the group in the identity source.

Use the following endpoints to bulk load groups. Each endpoint also lists example payload requests and response bodies:

* [Upload the group memberships to be upserted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupsForUpsert)
* [Upload the group memberships to be deleted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupMembershipsForUpsert)

## Identity Sources API flow

Before you start to build your XaaS data synchronization client, you need to set up a few configuration variables:

* Your Okta org domain URL (`{yourOktaDomain}`) for API requests
* Your Custom Identity Source ID (`{identitySourceId}`): The unique identifier that you obtained from configuring a Custom Identity Source integration in your Okta org. See Create and configure a Custom Identity Source in [Use Anything-as-a-Source](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-use-xaas).
* An API token (`{apiKey}`): Obtain an [API token](/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/) from your Okta org to make secure API calls to Okta. Use this API token in the SSWS Authorization header.

Code your XaaS data synchronization client with the following generalized API flow:

1. Create an identity source session.
2. Load  data into the identity source session. (If loading data in bulk, you can load multiple batches of bulk data).
3. Trigger the data import process.
4. Monitor the identity source session until the data processing completes.

The following diagram shows the flow for user data, but generally applies for all entities:

For detailed API calls, see the following for specific use case flows:

* [Create an identity source session](#create-an-identity-source-session)
* [Bulk import data](#bulk-import-data)
* [Bulk deactivate data](#bulk-deactivate-data)
* [Start the data import process](#start-the-data-import-process)
* [Cancel an identity source session](#cancel-an-identity-source-session)
* [Monitor identity source sessions](#monitor-identity-source-sessions)

### Create an identity source session

Before you can start uploading the data from your HR source to Okta, you need to [create an identity source session](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/createIdentitySourceSession).

> **Note:** Only `"importType": "INCREMENTAL"` is supported for an identity source session.

After you create the identity source, you can load data to it, cancel it, or monitor it.

### Bulk import data

Use these steps to insert or update a set of user data profiles from your HR source to Okta.

> **Note:** Use the same flow for uploading groups from your HR source, but with the groups endpoints instead. For groups, use the [Upload the group memberships to be upserted](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupMembershipsForUpsert) endpoint or the [Upload the group profiles without memberships to be upserted](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupsForUpsert) endpoint.

1. [Create an identity source session](#create-an-identity-source-session) if you don't already have one. If you have an existing active identity source session, [retrieve the active identity source session](#retrieve-active-identity-source-sessions) to get the session ID.

2. [Upload bulk-upsert user data](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceDataForUpsert):

    * Use the `id` property value returned from the created identity source session to make the bulk-upsert data request.
    * Obtain the user profiles from your HR source and add each user profile and their attributes into the `profiles` array. You can have up to a maximum of 200 user profiles in the array.
    * Set `entityType` to `USERS`. Only user data is supported for this endpoint.
    * If you need to add more users, make another bulk-upsert data request with the same `{sessionId}` value. You can make up to 50 bulk-load requests for one identity source session.

3. [Start the data import process](#start-the-data-import-process).

4. You can monitor the identity source session until the data processing completes by reviewing the status of the session. See [Monitor identity source sessions](#monitor-identity-source-sessions).

### Bulk deactivate data

When users are deactivated or deleted from your HR source, you need to reflect that status in Okta. Okta doesn't delete user profile objects. It deactivates the users that are no longer active. Use these steps to deactivate a set of user data profiles from Okta.

> **Note:** Use the same flow for deleting groups from your HR source, but with the groups endpoints instead. To delete group memberships, use the [Upload the group memberships to be deleted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupMembershipsForDelete) endpoint and list the `groupExternalId` and `memberExternalIds` in the request body. To delete groups without specific membership information, use the [Upload the group external IDs to be deleted in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceGroupsDataForDelete) endpoints and list the `externalIds` of groups to be deleted.

1. [Create an identity source session](#create-an-identity-source-session) if you don't already have one. If you have an existing active identity source session, [retrieve the active identity source session](#retrieve-active-identity-source-sessions) to get the `{sessionId}`.

2. [Upload bulk-delete data](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/uploadIdentitySourceDataForDelete):

    * Use the `id` property value returned from the created identity source session to make the bulk-delete data request.
    * Obtain the unique user identifiers from your HR source and add each `externalId` value into the `profiles` array. You can have up to a maximum of 200 user IDs in the array.
    * Set `entityType` to `USERS`. Only user data is supported. Group data isn't currently supported.
    * If you need to deactivate more users, make another bulk-delete data request with the same `{sessionId}` value. You can make up to 50 bulk-load requests for one identity source session.

    > **Note:** If the `externalId` of the user profile in the bulk-delete data isn't matched to a user in Okta, then the user profile is silently ignored.

3. [Start the data import process](#start-the-data-import-process).

4. You can monitor the identity source session until the data processing completes by reviewing the status of the session. See [Monitor identity source sessions](#monitor-identity-source-sessions).

### Start the data import process

After you finish loading the data you want to insert, update, or delete, [start the data import process](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/startImportFromIdentitySource) from the identity source to Universal Directory. After you've started the import process, the identity source session status moves to `TRIGGERED`. After the import is done, the identity source session status moves to `COMPLETED`.

### Cancel an identity source session

If there's an identity source session with the `CREATED` status for your identity source and you don't want to run the import process, then you can cancel the session. This operation deletes all loaded data in the identity source session and sets the session status to `CLOSED`.

Use the [Delete an identity source session](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/deleteIdentitySourceSession) operation to cancel the identity source session and delete all the bulk data associated with the session.

### Monitor identity source sessions

To monitor identity source session activity for an identity source, use one of these methods to retrieve session properties:

* [Retrieve active identity source sessions](#retrieve-active-identity-source-sessions)
* [Retrieve an identity source session by ID](#retrieve-an-identity-source-session-by-id)

#### Retrieve active identity source sessions

The [List all identity source sessions](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/listIdentitySourceSessions) request returns a list of active identity source sessions for an identity source. This list helps determine which sessions are currently processing and actively being worked on. An identity source session is considered active if it has the `CREATED` or `TRIGGERED` status. Data processing is complete for an identity source if no active session is returned (since a session that contains the `COMPLETED` status isn't considered active).

> **Note:** Alternatively, you can use the [Import Monitoring](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-view-import-monitoring-dashboard) page from the Admin Console to monitor the import process job. When the job completes, a summary of the import process appears in the Import Monitoring dashboard.

#### Retrieve an identity source session by ID

The [Retrieve an identity source session](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentitySource/#tag/IdentitySource/operation/getIdentitySourceSession) request returns the identity source session properties for a specific session ID. Data processing is completed if the returned session status is `COMPLETED`.
