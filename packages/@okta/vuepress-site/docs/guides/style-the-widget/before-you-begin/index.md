The Okta Sign-In Widget is a JavaScript library that gives you a fully-featured and customizable sign-in experience that can be used to authenticate users on any website. How you customize the Widget depends on whether Okta is hosting it or you are embedding it in your app (self-hosting the Widget).

* Self-hosted Sign-in Widget: After you have [installed the Okta Sign-In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#getting-started) into your project and configured the authentication scenarios that you want to support, you can then customize. You can apply customizations to match your branding using CSS and JavaScript. See <GuideLink link="../style-self-hosted">Styling the self-hosted Sign-In Widget</GuideLink>.

* Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget: Okta hosts the sign-in page that appears when your applications redirect to Okta to sign users in. You can customize the Okta-hosted sign-in page using easy controls or an embedded HTML editor that is provided.  To customize the sign-in page, select **Settings** and then **Customization** in the Admin Console's side navigation. On the **Customization** page, click the **Custom Sign In** tab.
