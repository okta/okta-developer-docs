title: Get submitted credentials
---

We need to get the values of `data.credential.username` and `data.credential.password` from within the body of the Password Import Inline Hook request received from Okta. These properties contain the credentials submitted by the end user who is trying to sign in.

> **Note:** Make sure to have the required default code and packages in your project. See [Overview and considerations](/docs/guides/common-hook-set-up-steps)--> for further information.
