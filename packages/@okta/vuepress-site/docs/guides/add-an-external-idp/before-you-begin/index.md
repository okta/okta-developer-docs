You want to give your users the freedom to choose which Identity Provider that they can use to sign in to your application. Okta manages connections to Identity Providers for your application, sitting between your application and the Identity Provider that authenticates your users.

We also support additional services such as directories and credential providers. See the [Okta Integration Network Catalog](https://www.okta.com/okta-integration-network/) to browse all integrations by use case.

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. (Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).)
* Have an application that you want to add authentication to.

> **Note:** This guide doesn't explain the differences between SAML and OpenID Connect and doesn't help you choose between them. See [External Identity Providers](/docs/concepts/identity-providers/#the-big-picture) for more information.

## Supported Identity Providers

We support a lot of Identity Providers. This guide provides instructions for the following Identity Providers. If the provider that you need isn't listed, we may still support it through generic OpenID Connect or SAML. The Identity Provider's documentation should say which protocol you need to use.
