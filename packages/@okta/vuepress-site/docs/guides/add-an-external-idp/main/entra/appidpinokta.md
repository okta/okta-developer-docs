* **Client Id**: Paste the client ID that you obtained from Microsoft Entra ID when you configured the IdP in the previous section.
* **Client Secret**: Paste the secret that you obtained in the previous section.
* **Scopes**: Leave the defaults. These scopes are included when Okta makes an OpenID Connect request to Microsoft Entra ID.

In the **Endpoints** section:

Add the following endpoint URLs for the Microsoft Entra ID IdP that you're configuring.

* **Issuer**: The identifier of the Microsoft Entra ID IdP: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{Directory(tenant)ID}/v2.0`
* **Authorization endpoint**: The URL of the Microsoft Entra ID OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint. For example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{Directory(tenant)ID}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`
* **Token endpoint**: The URL of the Microsoft Entra ID token endpoint for obtaining access and ID tokens. For example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{Directory(tenant)ID}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
* **JWKS endpoint**: The URL of the Microsoft Entra ID JSON Web Key Set document. This document contains signing keys that are used to validate the signatures from the provider. For example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{Directory(tenant)ID}/discovery/v2.0/keys`

  > **Note:** These URL values are obtained from the previous [Create an app at the Identity Provider](#create-an-app-at-the-identity-provider) section.
