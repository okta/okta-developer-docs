* **Scopes** &mdash; Leave the defaults. These scopes are included when Okta makes an OpenID Connect request to Apple. See the [scope page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/clientconfigi/3230955-scope) for more information on the scopes that are required by Apple.

    > **Note:** By default, Okta requires the `email` attribute for a user. The `email` scope is required to create and link the user to Okta's Universal Directory.
