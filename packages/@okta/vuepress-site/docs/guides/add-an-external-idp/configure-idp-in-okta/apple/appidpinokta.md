In the **General Settings** section:

* **Name** &mdash; Enter the name that you would expect to see on a button, such as **Sign in with Apple**.
* **Client ID** &mdash; Paste the Services ID (??is it Services ID or Service ID??) that you obtained from Apple when you configured the Identity Provider in the <GuideLink link="../create-an-app-at-idp">previous section</GuideLink>. The Service ID identifies the particular instance of your app and is used as the `client_id`.
* **Client Secret Signing Key** &mdash; Paste the secret that you obtained in the <GuideLink link="../create-an-app-at-idp">previous section</GuideLink>.
* **Key ID** &mdash; Enter the Key ID that you obtained from Apple when you configured the identity Provider in the <GuideLink link="../create-an-app-at-idp">previous section</GuideLink>. The Key ID represents the private key generated by Apple.
* **Team ID** &mdash; Enter the Apple Team ID. This appears in several places in the Apple Developer Portal, most notably in the upper-right corner of the screen beneath your name. (Check if this just appears or if they need to click the down arrow next to the name)
* **Scopes** &mdash; Leave the defaults. These scopes are included when Okta makes an OpenID Connect request to Azure AD.

    By default, Okta requires the `email` attribute for a user. The `email` scope is required to create and link the user to Okta's Universal Directory.
