Okta supports smart cards with an X.509 compliant digital certificate, such as a personal identity verification card, as a primary authentication factor to sign in to Okta. To configure this feature in Okta, you need to add Smart Card as an external Identity Provider.

See [Add a Smart Card IdP](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-idp-smart-card-workflow).
