You should now understand how to add an external Identity Provider and have successfully <GuideLink link="../create-an-app-at-idp">added</GuideLink> and <GuideLink link="../use-idp-to-sign-in">tested the authorization URL</GuideLink> with the external Identity Provider.

To add another Identity Provider:
* If you have already created an app at the Identity Provider, start by <GuideLink link="../configure-idp-in-okta">configuring the Identity Provider in Okta</GuideLink>.
* If you haven't already created an app at the Identity Provider, start by <GuideLink link="../create-an-app-at-idp/">creating an app at the Identity Provider</GuideLink>.

> **Note:** You don't need to <GuideLink link="../register-app-in-okta">register another app in Okta</GuideLink> unless you want to use a different application with the new Identity Provider that you are creating.
