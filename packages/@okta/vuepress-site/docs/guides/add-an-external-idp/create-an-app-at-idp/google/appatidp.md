2. Create a Google project using these [instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in#before_you_begin).

3. Save the OAuth client ID and secret values so you can add them to the Okta configuration in the next section.

> **Note:** There may be additional settings on the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com) site that you can configure for the app. The steps in this guide address the quickest route to setting up Google as an Identity Provider with Okta. See the Google documentation for more information on additional configuration settings.
