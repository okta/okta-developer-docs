You need recent versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Create a React application named `okta-react-quickstart` and enter the project route using the following command. This creates a React application using React version 17.

```shell
npx create-react-app@5 okta-react-quickstart
cd okta-react-quickstart
```

> **Note**: This guide was tested with Create React App 5, React 17, Okta React 6.4, and Okta Auth JS 6.1.

> **Note**: You can also install the Okta CLI and run `okta start react` to download and configure a React app with Okta integrated. This quickstart uses Create React App's output instead, as it's easier to understand the Okta-specific additions if you work through them yourself.
