* **Name**: Enter a name for the Identity Provider configuration.
* **Client ID**: Paste the Services ID that you obtained from Apple when you configured the Identity Provider in the previous section. The Services ID identifies the particular instance of your app and is used as the OAuth `client_id`.
* **Client Secret Signing Key**: Click **Browse files** and locate the key file (.p8 format) that you downloaded from Apple when you created the private key for client authentication in the previous section.
* **Key ID**: Enter the Key ID that you obtained from Apple when you created the private key for client authentication in the previous section. The Key ID represents the private key generated by Apple.
* **Team ID**: Enter your Apple Team ID value from your Apple developer account. You can find this ID in the upper-right corner of your Apple developer dashboard just below your account name.
* **Scopes**: Leave the defaults. These scopes are included when Okta makes an OpenID Connect request to Apple. See the [scope](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/clientconfigi/3230955-scope) property for Sign in with Apple.

    By default, Okta requires the `email` attribute for a user. The `email` scope is required to create and link the user to Okta's Universal Directory. For Just In Time (JIT) provisioning, Okta also requires the `firstName` and `lastName` attributes for a user. Include the `name` scope if the Identity Provider needs to support JIT.
