> **Note:** With Sign In with Apple, when a user signs in, Apple offers the user the option to either share their email address or hide it. If the user chooses to hide their email address, Apple generates a random email address and sends that to Okta. However, Apple maintains the mapping between this random email address and the user's original email address. The user must choose the **Share My Email** option if you want to link the user's Apple account to an existing account in Okta. A user can choose this option only when the user is signing in with Apple to Okta for the first time.
