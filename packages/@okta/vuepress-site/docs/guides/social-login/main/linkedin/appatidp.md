At LinkedIn, create the client application that you want to use for authenticating and authorizing your users.

1. Create an app in the [LinkedIn Developer portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new).

2. From your app, click the **Auth** tab and make note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values so that you can add them to the Okta configuration in the next section.

3. From the **Auth** tab, under **OAuth 2.0 settings**, click the pencil next to **Authorized redirect URLs for your app**.
  You need to enter a redirect URL in this field. The redirect URL:
    * Is where the IdP returns the authentication response (the access token and the ID token)
    * Needs to be a secure domain that you own
    * Should match the redirect URI sent in the authorize request from the client
    * Has the same structure for most Identity Providers in Okta and is constructed using your Okta subdomain and the callback endpoint.
    For example, if your Okta subdomain is called `company`, then the URL would be: `https://company.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`. If you have configured a custom domain in your Okta Org, use that value to build your redirect URL, such as `https://login.company.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`.

    Include all base domains (Okta domain and custom domain) that your users will interact with in the allowed redirect URI list.

4. Paste the redirect URL into the box.

5. Click **Update**.

6. From the **Products** tab, in the **Sign In with LinkedIn** box, click **Select**.

7. In the resulting dialog box, select **I have read and agree to these terms**, and then click **Add Product**.

> **Note:** You must explicitly request the `r_liteprofile` and `r_emailaddress` scopes when requesting an authorization code. See [Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?context=linkedin%2Fconsumer%2Fcontext&tabs=HTTPS) for more information.

Example: `scope=r_liteprofile r_emailaddress w_member_social`

> **Note:** The steps in this guide address the quickest route to setting up LinkedIn as an Identity Provider with Okta. See the [LinkedIn documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication?context=linkedin/consumer/context) for more information on additional configuration settings.
