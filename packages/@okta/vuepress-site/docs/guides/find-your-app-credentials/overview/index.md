If you're building an application using one of our SDKs or client libraries, you may run into the following message:

> **Note:** Your client ID is missing. Replace `{clientId}` with the client ID of your Application. You can copy it from the Okta Developer Console in the details for the Application that you created.

Or this one:

> **Note:** Your client secret is missing. Replace `{clientSecret}` with the client secret of your Application. You can copy it from the Okta Developer Console in the details for the Application that you created.

The first step in building an Application with Okta is creating an Okta Application resource that represents your project. Okta generates credentials for you (called a client ID and client secret) that you copy into your code to associate your project with the Okta Application.
