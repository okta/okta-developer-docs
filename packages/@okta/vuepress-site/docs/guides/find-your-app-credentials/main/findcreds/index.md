---

To find the credentials for your app integration:

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.
1. In the Admin Console, go to **Applications** > **Applications**.
1. If you already have the app integration in your org, you can search for it here. Click the app integration to open the settings page.
1. If you need to create a new Okta app integration to represent your project, click **Create App Integration** and follow the [instructions](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Apps_App_Integration_Wizard) to create a new app integration. Alternatively, you can search for a pre-existing app integration in the Okta catalog and add it to your org by clicking **Browse App Catalog**.
1. On the **General** tab, the **Client Credentials** section shows the client ID and client secret values for your app integration.
1. You can copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** values using the **Copy to Clipboard** button beside each text field.
