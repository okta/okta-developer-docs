To find your Application's credentials:

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.
2. In the Admin Console, click **Applications**.
3. If you haven't created an Okta Application to represent your project, click **Add Application** and follow the instructions. Otherwise, select your Application from the list.
4. On the **General** tab, scroll down to the **Client Credentials** section.
5. Copy the client ID and/or client secret using the **Copy to Clipboard** buttons to the right of each text field.
