title: Understand the app submission process
---

The submission review process begins after you click **Submit for Review** in the OIN Manager. Okta sends you an email notification that your app is now queued for review by an Okta App Analyst, along with a date by which the initial review will be completed.

The OIN Manager always shows the current status of your app.

### Step 1: Initial Review

* **Pending review by Okta** &mdash; Okta App Analysts are notified of your submission. Okta App Analysts review the app submission and notify you by email when the submission review is complete.
* **Action required** &mdash; Okta has reviewed your submission and found issues that require your correction. Check your email for results from the Okta initial review. Sign in to OIN Manager, update the requested details, and click **Submit for Review**. After the submission review is complete, the App Analyst moves it to Step 2 for QA testing.

### Step 2: Code Review

* **Pending review by Okta** &mdash; Okta App Analysts are now conducting internal QA tests and will notify you by email when the QA review is complete.
* **Action required** &mdash; Okta has found QA issues that require your correction. Check your email for results from the Okta QA review. Make the requested changes as an update to your existing submission.

### Step 3: Approved

* **Action required** &mdash; Your app submission has passed the QA testing process. Click **Publish Integration** to approve it for publication to the OIN catalog.
* **Pending review by Okta** &mdash; An Okta App Analysts will publish your submission within 3 business days.

### Step 4: Published

* Congratulations, your app is published in the OIN!
