title: Publish an app integration with Okta Integration Network
---

The Okta Integration Network (OIN) is the identity industry’s broadest and deepest set of pre-built cloud integrations to manage access management, authentication, and provisioning. By adding your app to the OIN, you can gain exposure to thousands of Okta customers who can discover and deploy your app to millions of users. OIN apps speed adoption by simplifying configuration steps and reducing friction for your customers.

If you are an independent software vendor (ISV), Okta customer, or IT system integrator who wants to add their app integration to the [Okta Integration Network](https://www.okta.com/integrations/), read this guide for instructions on how to submit your app. Integrating your application with the Okta Integration Network is completely cost free.

## Protocols supported

This guide covers app submissions that use one or more of the protocols:

* [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/)
* [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0), Version 2.0
* [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)](http://www.simplecloud.info/), Versions 2.0 and 1.1

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite to submitting your app, you must have a functional app created and tested in accordance with one of our OIN guides:

* [Build a SCIM provisioning integration](/docs/guides/build-provisioning-integration/)
* [Build a Single-Sign On integration](/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/before-you-begin/).

## Submission process

After you have built a functioning app integration, a few steps are required to submit it for Okta review and publication in the OIN. In general:

1. Create a customer-facing configuration guide.
1. Submit your app to Okta through the OIN Manager tool. Your submission must provide Okta with the general and protocol-specific metadata needed to create a customized app for publication in the OIN.
1. Work with Okta App Analysts who will test your application with your input and get your app published to the OIN App Catalog.

If you need additional help with the publication process, you can post a question on the [Okta Developer Forum](https://devforum.okta.com/) or email us at <developers@okta.com>.

>**Note:** All apps in the OIN catalog are public. If you want to submit a private app request for: SCIM 1.1 apps, Profile Master apps, or apps that use a custom header expression for Header Auth, then use the SCIM App Wizard to create your app and send an email to <developers@okta.com>. Okta App Analysts will help you to create an internal-only app that is not included in the OIN.
