title: Publishing an app integration with Okta Integration Network
---

This guide outlines the process by which independent software vendors (ISVs), Okta customers, or IT system integrators can submit an app for review by Okta with the goal of publishing it to the [Okta Integration Network](https://www.okta.com/integrations/). Integrating your application with the Okta Integration Network is completely cost free.

For details on how to build a SCIM provisioning integration, see our [SCIM Provisioning Guide](/docs/guides/build-provisioning-integration/).

For details on how to build a SAML Single Sign-On integration, see our [SAML Guide](/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/).

Our goal is to help you identity-enable your application using industry standards. The guidance offered here for SAML and SCIM allows you to integrate with customers using other identity solutions.

To get your app published in the OIN:

1. Sign up for an [OIN Developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).
1. Prepare and test your app before submission.
1. Submit your app to Okta through the OIN Manager tool.
1. Work with Okta App Analysts who will test your application with your input and publish your app to the OIN App Catalog.

If you need additional help with the publication process, see the [Frequently Asked Questions](../faqs/), post a question on the [Okta Developer Forum](https://devforum.okta.com/) or email us at <developers@okta.com>.
