title: Update your published app
---

If you need to change your app that is already published in the OIN catalog, you can visit the [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com/) and create a new version of the app.

1. Sign on to the OIN Manager using the credentials for your original dev org.
1. The published app appears on your app integrations page. Click **Update**.

    This creates a new instance of your application where you can safely change any of the parameters. Your existing app remains in the OIN catalog with the previous settings until this new version is published.
1. Update any of the parameters for your existing protocols, or add a new protocol depending on your needs.

    If you need to leave the in-progress submission at any point, you can return to it through the OIN Manager. When you sign on again, you will see the published version and your in-progress version. Click **View** on the in-progress version to pick up where you left off.
1. When you have completed the updates, or have filled the new protocol information so that indicator shows 100% complete, you can click **Submit for Review**.

    At this point, the Okta App Analysts are notified and your submission undergoes the same process flow as the original submission.

    After the new version of the app has reached the **Publish** stage and been published by Okta, the new version replaces the old one in the OIN catalog.
