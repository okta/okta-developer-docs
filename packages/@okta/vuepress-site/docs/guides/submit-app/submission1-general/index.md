To start your integration submission, open the [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com) and click **Start Submission Form**.

Sign in using your development org credentials and click **Add New Submission** to create a new submission instance.

If you want to review an in-progress submission, click **View** beside the name of your integration.

If you need to update an integration, see [Update your published integration](/docs/guides/submit-app/update-submission).

In the General Settings page, you need to fill in the basic information about your integration:

## App information

* **Does your app exist in the OIN?** &mdash; If your integration already exists in the OIN, provide the **Existing OIN app name** so that the Okta OIN team can locate it.

* **What changes are you making to the existing OIN integration?** &mdash; If your integration already exists in the OIN, summarize the changes that you are requesting in your update. This summary helps the Okta OIN team address your changes.

* **App name** &mdash; Provide a name for your integration. This is the main title used for your integration in the OIN.

* **App website** &mdash; Provide a link to your product or service homepage, or a specific location on your website where users can learn more about your integration.

* **App category** &mdash; Specify a category for Okta to categorize your integration in the OIN catalog.

* **App description** &mdash; Give a general description of your application and what the Okta integration does. For examples, see the overview section for any of the integrations listed on the [OIN](https://www.okta.com/integrations/).

* **App icon** &mdash; Upload a PNG, JPG, or GIF file of a logo to accompany your integration in the catalog. The image must have dimensions of less than 1400 by 400 pixels. It also must be 1 megabyte or smaller in size.

## Customer support

* **Public support contact** &mdash; Include a public point of contact (support email or phone number) for users who need assistance with your integration. You can also include a link to a FAQ or troubleshooting guide to help with common issues. This information is shared with the customers in the OIN catalog description.

* **Escalation support contact** &mdash; This should be an email distribution list for Okta to use when contacting your company about your integration. It can be a phone number, but ideally when there is an issue with your integration, Okta wants to reach as many people as possible without creating any bottlenecks. Make sure that the contact provided here is not a generic contact such as `support@example.com` or a 1-800 number. The escalation contact should be a contact list that Okta can reach out to in any emergencies. This contact information is not shared with customers.

## Test account

The Okta OIN team requires a dedicated account on your application to run their tests. This account needs to be kept active beyond the submission period in case Okta needs to update or troubleshoot a submission.

* **Test account URL** &mdash; This is a static URL for Okta to sign on to your application. The account credentials you provide below must work for this URL.

* **Test account username or email** &mdash; The account name for Okta to use to sign on to your application. Our preferred account name is `isvtest@okta.com`

* **Test account password** &mdash; Password for the test account.

* **Additional instructions** &mdash; Include any other information that you think the Okta OIN team needs to know about your integration, the test account, or the testing configuration.
