title: Prepare your app for submission
---

After you have built a functioning app integration in either [SAML](/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/) or [SCIM](/docs/guides/build-provisioning-integration/), a few steps are required to submit it for Okta review.

Your submission must provide Okta with all the metadata needed to create a customized app for publication in the OIN.

Complete the following steps before you submit your SCIM app:

1. Check the [profile attributes and their mappings](/docs/guides/build-provisioning-integration/attribute-mapping/) for your app.
1. [Test your Okta integration](/docs/guides/build-provisioning-integration/test-scim-app/) using the Okta SCIM CRUD test suite on Runscope.
1. Prepare your [customer-facing configuration guide](/docs/guides/build-provisioning-integration/prepare-guide/).
1. Optionally, create a demo video showing a working integration.
1. Run through the [Okta SCIM test plan](/standards/SCIM/SCIMFiles/okta-scim-test-plan.xlsx) spreadsheet.

Complete the following steps before you submit your SAML app:

1. [Prepare your application](/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/overview/).
1. [Test your app](/docs/concepts/saml/#testing-saml).
1. [Integrate your app](/docs/guides/build-sso-integration/integrate/).

After performing these steps, you are ready to go to the OIN Manager to submit your app and start tracking the review status.
