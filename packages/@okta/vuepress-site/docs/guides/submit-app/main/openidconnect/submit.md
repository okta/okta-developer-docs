#### OIDC settings

* **Does your Redirect URI vary per tenant?**: If **Yes**, a new field appears to assist you in setting up a per tenant configuration.
  * **What variables do your admins need to specify to install your app?**: When you click **+ Add Variable**, the interface displays a dialog to collect the following information:
    * **Label Name**: A descriptive name for the dynamic variable that administrators see when installing your app integration.
    * **Variable Name**: An automatically generated variable used when constructing the dynamic address. This is hidden from admins and is only passed to your external application.
    * **Help Text**: Any descriptive text to be shown to administrators when installing your app integration.
    * **Type**: The property type for your parameter. Options are "String", "URL", or "HTTPS URL".

    Click **Save** to add the variable to the list.

    After you create the variable, click the pencil icon to make changes to the details, the clipboard icon to copy the **Variable Name** to your local clipboard, or the "X" icon to remove the variable entirely.

  * **Construct your dynamic Redirect URI by copying the variables above and pasting them where applicable**: Provide one or more complete sign-in redirect URIs where Okta sends the OAuth responses for your app integration. You must add at least one valid redirect URI.

    If you're using a per tenant design, include the variable names that you created. For example:
    * https://`${app.variableName}`.okta.com
    * https://okta-`${app.variableName}`.com
    * `${app.variableName}/route`

    > **Note**: A variable can include a complete URL (for example, https://example.com). This enables you to use more globally useful variables such as `${org.baseURL}`.

* **Do you require an Initiate Login URI** (Optional): Include a sign-in URI if you want the Okta integration to handle redirecting your users to your application to start the sign-in request. When end users click a tile in their Okta dashboard, they are redirected to the `initiate_login_uri` of the client application, which constructs an authorization request and redirects the end user back to Okta.

  * **Does your Initiate Login URI vary per tenant?**: If **Yes**, an additional field appears to assist you in setting up a per tenant configuration. The instructions for adding and using the custom variables are identical to the per tenant instructions for the Redirect URI.

  * **Enter your Initiate Login URI**: Provide the complete sign-in URI for your app integration, including the variable names if you're using a per tenant design.

* **Do you require a Post Logout Redirect URI?** (Optional): Include a sign-out Redirect URI if you have a location where you want to send your end user after they sign out of your application.

  * **Does your Post Logout URI vary per tenant?**: If **Yes**, an additional field appears to assist you in setting up a per tenant configuration. The instructions for adding and using the custom variables are identical to the per tenant instructions for the Redirect URI.

  * **Enter your Post Logout Redirect URI**: Provide the complete sign-out redirect URI for your app integration, including the variable names if you're using a per tenant design.

* **Okta requires that all OIDC integrations support multi-tenancy. Do you support this in your implementation?**: Select **Yes** if your customers can set up an OIDC connection between their tenant in your application and multiple external IdPs or even multiple instances inside a single IdP.

* **To configure OIDC, can your customers do it by themselves from your app's UI, or do they need to contact your support team?**: If a customer needs support to configure your app integration, you need to include support contact information in your configuration guide. We recommend that you build a UI that enables self-service configuration to reduce the setup time for your customers.

* **Link to configuration guide**: Your configuration guide (in HTML or PDF format) should have step-by-step instructions on how to configure SSO between Okta and your systems. See [Customer configuration document guidelines](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#customer-configuration-document-guidelines).

* **What type of sign-in flows do you support?**: Choose either **IdP initiated** or **SP initiated**, or both.

* **Select the OIDC mode supported by your application**: Choose either **SPA** (for Single-Page Application) or **Web**.
