* **What SCIM version should this integration use?**: Choose either **SCIM 2.0** (Okta preferred version) or **SCIM 1.1**.

* **Link to configuration guide**: Your configuration guide (in HTML or PDF format) should have step-by-step instructions on how to set up provisioning between Okta and your systems. See [Customer configuration document guidelines](/docs/guides/submit-app-prereq/main/#customer-configuration-document-guidelines).

* **Select provisioning features to be supported in the integration**: These provisioning features should match what you have selected on the **Provisioning** tab in the settings for your SCIM integration. For details on each of these options, see [Configure provisioning for an app integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_prov_lcm_prov_app) and [Profile Sourcing activation](/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-test/main/#profile-sourcing-activation).

* **Does your Base URL vary per tenant?**: If **Yes**, a new field appears to assist you in setting up a per tenant configuration.
  * **What variables do your admins need to specify to install your app?**: When you click **Add Variable**, the interface displays a dialog box to collect the following information:
    * **Label Name**: A descriptive name for the dynamic variable that administrators see when installing your app integration.
    * **Variable Name**: An automatically generated variable used when constructing the dynamic address. This is hidden from admins and is only passed to your external application.
    * **Help Text**: Any descriptive text to be shown to administrators when installing your app integration.
    * **Type**: The property type for your parameter. Options are "String", "URL", or "HTTPS URL".

    Click **Save** to add the variable to the list.

    After you create the variable, click the pencil icon to make changes to the details, the clipboard icon to copy the **Variable Name** to your local clipboard, or the "X" icon to remove the variable entirely.

  * **Construct your dynamic Base URL by copying the variables above and pasting them where applicable**: Provide the Base URL that your integration uses when sending an outbound call to your SCIM server.

    If you're using a per tenant design, include the variable names that you created. For example:

    * https://`${app.variableName}`.okta.com
    * https://okta-`${app.variableName}`.com
    * `${app.variableName}`/route

    > **Note**: A variable can include a complete URL (for example, https://example.com). This enables you to use more globally useful variables such as `${org.baseURL}`.

* **Does your SCIM server support HTTP PATCH operations for modifying resources?**: Select **Yes** if your SCIM server supports updates made through a PATCH.

* **What authentication mode should the integration use?**: The authentication method must match what your SCIM server expects to receive.

  * Header authentication: Specify what format the token is sent to the server.
  * OAuth 2.0: Specify the token and authorization endpoint URLs for your SCIM server, along with the consumer key and secret.

* **Does your SCIM `userName` attribute value follow an email address format?**: Select **Yes** if your SCIM server uses a `name@company.TLD` format for the unique `userName` attribute.

* **Did you delete all unused attributes?**: As outlined in [Check the attributes and corresponding mappings ](/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-connect/main/#check-the-attributes-and-corresponding-mappings), you need to update the base attributes and mappings that correspond with the attributes supported by your application. Select **Yes** if you have completed the instructions in the **Remove the mapping** and **Delete attributes from your attribute list** sub-sections in the **Delete attributes** section of that guide.

* **How many Group membership changes are allowed in a custom PATCH operation?**: This value tells Okta the maximum number of Group membership changes to submit inside a single PATCH operation. When you organize these changes into smaller chunks, you can improve the efficiency of updates. Enter a numerical value between 100 and 1000.

  * The default value is 100.
  * Group membership PATCH operations timeout after 60 seconds.

* **Optional: link to demo video**: If you have a video that explains how to configure access to your SCIM application, enter the URL for it here.

* **Link to Runscope test results**: A link to the Runscope site test results that show your application passed the SPEC test suite. See [Test your SCIM API](/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-prepare/main/#test-your-scim-api).

* **Link to Runscope CRUD test results**: A link to the Runscope site test results that show your application passed the CRUD test suite. See [Test your Okta SCIM integration](/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-test/).

  > **Note:** Runscope CRUD test results aren't required if your application only supports the Import feature. Instead, enter a link to your SPEC test results for this field.

These Runscope test results must show that all tests are passing before the Okta OIN team approves a SCIM integration for the OIN.
