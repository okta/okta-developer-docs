Self-service registration allows users to sign up for the app themselves. In this use case, the user must register with a password and email or SMS factors.

To enable self-service registration:

1. Enable the self-service registration option for your app in the Okta org.
1. Build the self-service registration flow in your app.

## Factor setup

This use case requires the password and either the email or the phone factor.
