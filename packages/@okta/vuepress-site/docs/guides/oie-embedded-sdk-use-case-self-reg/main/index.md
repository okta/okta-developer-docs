Self-service registration allows users to sign up for the app themselves. In this use case, the user must register with a password, email, and/or phone factors.

To enable self-service registration:

1. Enable the self-service registration option for your app in the Okta org.
1. Build the self-service registration flow in your app.

This use case requires the password and either the email or the phone factor.

## Configuration updates

Before you can build the self-registration flow in your app, you must configure the Okta org to accept self-registration with the password, email, and/or phone factors. See [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case) to set up the password, email, and phone factors in your Okta org.

In addition to setting up the authentication factors, you also need to configure the following in your Okta org:

1. [Update the profile enrollment default policy](#_1-update-the-profile-enrollment-default-policy)
2. [Confirm that the org application is assigned to everyone](#_2-confirm-that-the-org-application-is-assigned-to-everyone)
3. [Set the Email and Phone authenticators as optional enrollment factors](#_3-set-the-email-and-phone-authenticators-as-optional-enrollment-factors)

### 1: Update the profile enrollment default policy

Enable self-registration in your profile enrollment default policy:

1. In the Admin Console, select **Security** > **Profile Enrollment** from the left-hand navigation pane.
1. On the **Profile Enrollment** page, click the pencil icon next to the Default Policy.

1. On the **Applications** page, select your application.
1. On your application page, select the **Assignments** tab.
1. From the left, click the **Groups** filter.

1. In the Admin console, select **Security** > **Authenticators** from the left-hand navigation pane
1. On the **Authenticators** page, click the **Enrollment** tab.
1. In **Default Policy**, click **Edit**.
1. Under the **Effective factors** section of the **Edit Policy** dialog box, set both email and phone authenticators to optional for enrollment:
