### Enroll and verify phone (SMS) factor

After the password and email are verified, the user has the option to
enroll in the phone factor.

> **Note:** Based on the steps described in [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case), the Okta application is set up to require one possession factor (either email or phone). After the email factor is verified, the phone factor becomes optional.

The following flow describes the steps when the user enrolls in the optional phone SMS factor.

### Skip optional remaining factors

The user can also opt to skip the factors when all of the remaining
factors are optional. In this case, the user opts to skip the phone
(SMS) factor.
