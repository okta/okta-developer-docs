### 1: Click the sign-up link

The self-registration flow begins when the user clicks the **Sign up** link. On the sign-in page, create a **Sign up** link that links to the create account page you create in the next step.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Sign up' link](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-sign-up.png)

</div>

> **Note:** The **Sign up** link appears in the following example under the **Continue** button.

### 2: Enter the profile data

The next step is to enter basic information (for example, email, first, and last name). Create a page that accepts this information. The following shows an example of a create account page.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Create your account' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-create.png)

</div>

### 3: Select Register

When the user clicks **Register**, create a `UserProfile` object and set its properties with the user profile information captured from the Create account page. Pass this object into the `IdxClient RegisterAsync` method.

```csharp
var idxAuthClient = new IdxClient();

var userProfile = new UserProfile();
userProfile.SetProperty("firstName", model.FirstName);
userProfile.SetProperty("lastName", model.LastName);
userProfile.SetProperty("email", model.Email);

var registerResponse = await idxAuthClient.RegisterAsync(userProfile);
```

### 4: Handle the register response

If the org's application is properly configured with multiple factors, `RegisterAsync` should return a response with an `AuthenticationStatus` of `AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment`. This status indicates that there is a required authenticator that needs to be verified. If you completed the steps properly in [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case), the authenticator is the **password** factor that is stored in the `Authenticators` list property.

```csharp
if (registerResponse.AuthenticationStatus == AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment)
    {
       Session["idxContext"] = registerResponse.IdxContext;
       TempData["authenticators"] = ViewModelHelper.
             ConvertToAuthenticatorViewModelList(registerResponse.Authenticators);
       return RedirectToAction("SelectAuthenticator", "Manage");
    }
```

### 5: Show the password authenticator

The next step is to build a page that shows a user the required factors that need to
be verified. After the call to `RegisterAsync`, the user needs to see the
password factor requirement and select it for verification.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Verify password' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-verify-password.png)

</div>

The page should be generic and should handle the list of authenticators that are returned from the various methods of the SDK. Use the `Authenticators` property in the returned response to build the list.

```csharp
var authenticators = (IList<AuthenticatorViewModel>)TempData["authenticators"];
var viewModel = new SelectAuthenticatorViewModel
  {
     Authenticators = authenticators,
     PasswordId = authenticators.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Name.ToLower() == "password")?.AuthenticatorId,
     PhoneId = authenticators.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Name.ToLower() == "phone")?.AuthenticatorId,
     CanSkip = TempData["canSkip"] != null && (bool)TempData["canSkip"]
  };

TempData["authenticators"] = viewModel.Authenticators;
return View(viewModel);
```

### 6: Submit the password authenticator

The next step is to call the `EnrollAuthenticatorAsync` method when the user
selects the authenticator. In this use case, the `AuthenticatorId` for the
**password** factor is passed.

```csharp
var enrollAuthenticatorOptions = new EnrollAuthenticatorOptions
{
     AuthenticatorId = model.AuthenticatorId,
};

var enrollResponse = await idxAuthClient.EnrollAuthenticatorAsync(enrollAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);
```

### 7: Handle the submit response

The `EnrollAuthenticatorAsync` call returns an `AuthenticationStatus`. If the enrollment is successful, this property should return `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification`. When `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification` is returned, the next step is to verify the authenticator. In this use case, the user needs to verify with the **password** authenticator.

```csharp
switch (enrollResponse?.AuthenticationStatus)
{
   case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification:
   if (model.IsPasswordSelected)
   {
      return RedirectToAction("ChangePassword", "Manage");
   }

   return RedirectToAction("VerifyAuthenticator", "Manage");

case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollmentData:
   return RedirectToAction("EnrollPhoneAuthenticator", "Manage");
default:
   return View("SelectAuthenticator", model);
}
```

### 8: Show the new password page

After `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification` is returned, the next step is to build a page that allows the user to verify the new password by supplying the password.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Confirm password' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-confirm-password.png)

</div>

### 9: Submit the new password

When the user fills out the new password and clicks **Register**, a call to `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync` is made to verify (in this use case, to set the password for
the new user). Use the `Code` property in the `VerifyAuthenticatorOptions` parameter
to store the new password.

```csharp
var idxAuthClient = new IdxClient(null);
           var verifyAuthenticatorOptions = new VerifyAuthenticatorOptions
           {
               Code = code,
           };

var authnResponse = await idxAuthClient.VerifyAuthenticatorAsync(verifyAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["idxContext"]);
```

### 10: Handle the submit response

If you completed the steps in [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case), which sets up multifactors for your application, `AuthenticationResponse.AuthenticationStatus` should return a status of `AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment`.

The `AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment` status is returned because the required **email** and optional **phone** factors await to be enrolled and verified. The user should be redirected to an authenticator list page.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Authenticator list' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-auth-list-email-phone.png)

</div>

> **Note:** In the previous screenshot, the **Skip** button is used to skip the authenticators. You can implement a **Skip** button on your authenticators list page when one of the authenticators is optional. Since the email factor is required but the phone is **optional**, the **Skip** button in this step is visible yet disabled. The **Skip** button is described in later steps.

The code snippet below shows how the response is handled. `AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment` identifies that there are additional factors (in this use case, email and optionally phone). The Authenticator list page is loaded again (the first time was for password) with the two additional
factors.

```csharp
switch (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus)
   {
       ...
       case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment:
           TempData["authenticators"] =
              ViewModelHelper.ConvertToAuthenticatorViewModelList(authnResponse.Authenticators);
              TempData["canSkip"] = authnResponse.CanSkip;
            return RedirectToAction("SelectAuthenticator", "Manage");
...
```

> **Note** The `CanSkip` property in the code sample above is used for optional factors. See the SDK sample for more information.

### 11: Submit the email authenticator

If the user selects the **email** authenticator, a call to `EnrollAuthenticatorAsync` is made and passes in the **email** `AuthenticatorId`. If successful, this call should send a code to the user's email.

```csharp
var enrollAuthenticatorOptions = new EnrollAuthenticatorOptions
{
     AuthenticatorId = model.AuthenticatorId,
};

var enrollResponse = await idxAuthClient.EnrollAuthenticatorAsync(enrollAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);
```

### 12 (Optional): Update the sent email template

The email sent to the user has a **Verify Email Address** link that isn't yet
supported. Accordingly, there are two recommended options to mitigate this limitation.
See
[Email link to verify email address not working](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-limitations/main/#email-link-to-verify-email-address-not-working).

### 13: Handle the submit response

If the call to `EnrollAuthenticatorAsync` was successful, it should return an `AuthenticationStatus` of `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification`. When `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification` is returned, a code is sent to the user's email, and the user needs to verify this code.

The following sample app code snippet shows that the user is redirected to the **Verify Authenticator** page to verify that the code was sent in the email.

```csharp
var enrollResponse = await idxAuthClient.EnrollAuthenticatorAsync(enrollAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);

switch (enrollResponse?.AuthenticationStatus)
{
   case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification:
        return RedirectToAction("VerifyAuthenticator", "Manage");
...
}
```

### 14: Obtain the email verification code from email

Build the email verification code page that accepts the code from the email.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Authenticator list' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-verify-email-code.png)

</div>

### 15: Submit the email code

The next step is to call `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync`. In the email verification, the code that is passed into `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync` is the code found in the verification email.

```csharp
var idxAuthClient = new IdxClient(null);
           var verifyAuthenticatorOptions = new VerifyAuthenticatorOptions
           {
               Code = code,
           };

var authnResponse = await idxAuthClient.VerifyAuthenticatorAsync(verifyAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["idxContext"]);
```

### 16: Handle the submit response

The next step is to handle the response from `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync`. If the email code was valid, the method should return `AuthenticationStatus` of `AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment`. This status signifies that there is another factor (required or optional) waiting to be enrolled and verified. If the steps described in [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case) were properly followed, the user should be sent back to the Authenticator list page that shows only the **phone** authenticator.

```csharp
var authnResponse = await _idxClient.VerifyAuthenticatorAsync(verifyAuthenticatorOptions,
     (IIdxContext)Session["idxContext"]);
Session["idxContext"] = authnResponse.IdxContext;

switch (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus)
      {
          case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollment:
               TempData["authenticators"] =
               ViewModelHelper.ConvertToAuthenticatorViewModelList
               (authnResponse.Authenticators);
               TempData["canSkip"] = authnResponse.CanSkip;
               return RedirectToAction("SelectAuthenticator", "Manage");
           ...
      }
```

### 17: Show the remaining list of authenticators

The remaining authenticator should display the phone factor to the user. Since this factor is currently optional and no other required factors need to be verified, the user should have the ability to skip the factor. Create a **Skip** button for this use case. This **Skip** button is governed by the `CanSkip` property on the `AuthenticationResponse`. See the following screenshot for an illustration.

<div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Phone list' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-auth-list-phone.png)

</div>

The user can either enroll in the phone factor or skip the phone factor. Your code should handle both scenarios that will be described in the following steps.

### 18: Handle the phone authenticator options

#### Option 1: Enroll and verify the phone authenticator

1. Start phone verification

   If the user selects the **phone** authenticator (instead of skipping it), a call to `EnrollAuthenticatorAsync` is made passing in the **phone** `AuthenticatorId`. If successful, the method should return an `AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollmentData` response. The `AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollmentData `response indicates that the enrollment data is required before continuing to verification.

   In the use case to verify the phone authenticator, the phone number is required, and the user should be redirected to a page where they can enter in a phone number. See the following code snippet from the sample app.

   ```csharp
   var enrollResponse = await _idxClient.EnrollAuthenticatorAsync(enrollAuthenticatorOptions,
      (IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);
   ...

   switch (enrollResponse?.AuthenticationStatus)
      {
            ...
            case AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorEnrollmentData:
                  return RedirectToAction("EnrollPhoneAuthenticator", "Manage");
            ...
         }
   ```

1. Show phone entry page

   Build the phone number entry page that accepts the phone number. The user uses the phone number entry page to enroll and verify.

   <div class="common-image-format">

![Displays an example 'Verify phone' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-verify-phone-num.png)

   </div>

   > **Note:** The SDK requires that the phone number be in the following format: `+#######`, including the beginning plus (+) sign. See [Data Requirements - Phone number](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-common/aspnet/main/#phone-number).

1. Submit phone number

   When the user enters their phone number and clicks the send code using the SMS button, a call to `EnrollAuthenticatorAsync` is made and passes the following values:

   * Authenticator ID
   * Phone number
   * Method type (only SMS is currently supported)

   > **Note:** Only SMS is currently supported for the phone authenticator type.

   The above values are passed using the `EnrollPhoneAuthenticatorOptions` parameter. See the following code snippet for more details.

   ```csharp
   var enrollPhoneAuthenticatorOptions = new EnrollPhoneAuthenticatorOptions
      {
         AuthenticatorId = Session["phoneId"].ToString(),
         PhoneNumber = model.PhoneNumber,
         MethodType = AuthenticatorMethodType.Sms,
      };

   var enrollResponse = await _idxClient.EnrollAuthenticatorAsync(enrollPhoneAuthenticatorOptions,
         (IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);
         Session["IdxContext"] = enrollResponse.IdxContext;
   ```

1. Handle the submit response

   If the call to `EnrollAuthenticatorAsync` is successful, it should return an `AuthenticationStatus` of `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification`. When `AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification` is returned, a code is sent to the phone number through SMS.

   In the following code snippet, the user is redirected to a reusable code verification page that handles the code for both email and SMS. Your implementation may vary.

   ```csharp
   var enrollResponse = await _idxClient.EnrollAuthenticatorAsync(enrollPhoneAuthenticatorOptions,
      (IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);
      ...
   if (enrollResponse.AuthenticationStatus ==
      AuthenticationStatus.AwaitingAuthenticatorVerification)
      {
         return RedirectToAction("VerifyAuthenticator", "Manage");
      }
   ```

1. Display phone verification code page

   Build a page that accepts the code sent to your phone number through SMS. Depending on your implementation, the page can be the same page that verifies the email code or different. The sample app reuses the same page for both email and phone verification.

![Displays an example 'Enter code from phone' form](/img/oie-embedded-sdk/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-simple-self-serv-screen-verify-phone-code.png)

</div>

1. Submit phone code

   After the user enters the phone code and clicks verify, a call is made to `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync`. In the phone verification use case, the code that passes into `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync` is the code that was sent through SMS to the phone number.

   ```csharp
   var idxAuthClient = new IdxClient(null);
            var verifyAuthenticatorOptions = new VerifyAuthenticatorOptions
            {
                  Code = code,
            };

   var authnResponse = await idxAuthClient.VerifyAuthenticatorAsync(verifyAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["idxContext"]);
   ```

1. Complete authentication

   The next step is to handle the response from `VerifyAuthenticatorAsync`. If the phone SMS code was valid, the method should return an `AuthenticationStatus` of `Success`. This status signifies that no more factors (required or optional) are waiting to be enrolled and verified.

   If the steps described in [Set up your Okta org (for multifactor use cases)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-multi-factor-use-cases) were properly followed, the user should now be registered with no more factors to be verified. The user should then be sent to the default page after they have successfully registered. In the sample application, the user is sent to the user profile page.

   ```csharp
   var authnResponse = await _idxClient.VerifyAuthenticatorAsync(verifyAuthenticatorOptions, (IIdxContext)Session["idxContext"]);
   Session["idxContext"] = authnResponse.IdxContext;

   switch (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus)
   {
      ...
      case AuthenticationStatus.Success:
            ClaimsIdentity identity = await
            AuthenticationHelper.GetIdentityFromTokenResponseAsync(_idxClient.Configuration,
            authnResponse.TokenInfo);
            _authenticationManager.SignIn(new AuthenticationProperties(), identity);
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
      ...
   }
   ```

#### Option 2: Skip phone enrollment

If the user opts to skip phone enrollment, a call to `SkipAuthenticatorSelectionAsync` needs to be made. This method skips phone enrollment and eliminates the need to verify the factor:

```csharp
try
{
      var skipSelectionResponse = await _idxClient.SkipAuthenticatorSelectionAsync
      ((IIdxContext)Session["IdxContext"]);

      switch (skipSelectionResponse.AuthenticationStatus)
      {
         case AuthenticationStatus.Success:
            ClaimsIdentity identity = await AuthenticationHelper.GetIdentityFromTokenResponseAsync
            (_idxClient.Configuration, skipSelectionResponse.TokenInfo);
            _authenticationManager.SignIn(new AuthenticationProperties(), identity);
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
      }
      return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
}
catch (TerminalStateException exception)
{
      TempData["TerminalStateMessage"] = exception.Message;
      return RedirectToAction("Login", "Account");
}
catch (OktaException exception)
{
      ModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, exception.Message);
      return RedirectToAction("SelectAuthenticator");
}
```

If `SkipAuthenticatorSelectionAsync` returns an `AuthenticationStatus` of `Success`, the registration is completed successfully.
The method can also throw exceptions for unsuccessful registrations such as the following:

* **`TerminalStateException`:** exception inherited from `OktaException` that's raised when an unexpected message
   is returned from the Okta API and no further remediation is possible.
* **`OktaException`:** general base exception that's raised when any Okta client and API exceptions are thrown.

After a successful registration, store the returned tokens in a session and send the user to the default signed-in page.
In the sample app, this page is the user profile page. See
[Get user profile information](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-in/#get-user-profile-information) for more details on how to fetch user information.

### Troubleshooting Tips

When you test this use case, ensure that you use a new email for each time. If you have a gmail account, you can reuse the same email by adding a plus (+) and additional text (for example, `myemail+1@gmail.com`, `myemail+2@gmail.com`, and so on). Ensure that the password that you use meets the minimum security requirements. For example, passwords such as `test123` fail.
