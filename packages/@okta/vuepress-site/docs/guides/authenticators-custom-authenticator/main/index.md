## About custom authentication and the Devices SDK

The Devices SDK allows you to embed push notifications and biometrics directly into your native mobile app. As a result, you can control the entire experience because users are prompted to continue the sign-in process on your mobile app. You arenâ€™t limited to using only Okta Verify for push notifications. Also, using custom authentication helps drive downloads of your app.

## Get started

This guide walks you through the two main tasks needed to integrate with Okta Devices SDK:

**Create a custom authenticator**

1. [Create an OIDC web authentication client](#create-an-oidc-web-authentication-client): Set up OAuth for your app.
2. [Grant the required scopes](#grant-the-required-scopes): Grant the scopes you need to create a custom authenticator.
3. [Set up notification services](#set-up-notification-services): Set up <StackSnippet snippet="notifservicelong" inline /> with your Okta org.
4. [Add a custom authenticator](#add-a-custom-authenticator): Create and brand a custom authenticator.
5. [Set up a global session policy and authentication policy](#set-up-a-global-session-policy-and-authentication-policy): Control who can access Okta and how.

**Install and configure the Okta Devices SDK**

1. [Install the dependency](#install-the-dependency): Add the Okta Devices SDK dependency to your `build.gradle` file.
2. [Initialize the client](#initialize-the-client): Create the SDK object to work with your Okta authenticator configuration.
3. [Enroll the device](#enroll-the-device): Register a device and optional biometrics with an account for use with the custom authenticator.
4. [Respond to a challenge](#respond-to-a-challenge): Resolve a delivered challenge from the custom authenticator or retrieve an undelivered challenge. Refresh the FCM device registration token, remediate changed biometrics, and deregister the account on the device.

### Create an OIDC web authentication client

The simplest way to integrate authentication in your app is with OIDC through a web browser, using the [Authorization Code flow grant type](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main/). You need an access token to start the enrollment flow for the Devices SDK. For future sign-in attempts, consider using refresh tokens. <StackSnippet snippet="samplecode" inline />

### Grant the required scopes

> **Note:** You must use an Org Authorization Server to grant the scopes needed to create a custom authenticator. Custom Authorization Servers (including the default Custom Authorization Server) don't work.

When you are ready to grant the required scopes, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account and go to **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Open your OpenID Connect client app.
3. On the **Okta API Scopes** tab, click **Grant** for the following scopes:
   * For access to both GET and POST/DELETE endpoints:
      * `okta.authenticators.manage.self`
   * For access to GET endpoints only:
      * `okta.authenticators.read`
      * `okta.users.read.self`

Alternatively, you can grant scopes using the [Grant consent to scope for application](/docs/reference/api/apps/#application-oauth-2-0-scope-consent-grant-operations) operation of the Apps API.

### Set up notification services

### Set up a global session policy and authentication policy

You need to set up a global session policy and an authentication policy to integrate with the Devices SDK. See [Configure a global session policy and authentication policy](/docs/guides/configure-signon-policy/main/).

## Limitations

### Custom authenticator error in Admin Console

#### Description

Use cases that meet the following conditions receive an error message in the Admin Console:

* Call the `api/v1/apps` endpoint to create an OIDC app with a custom `client_id`.
* Use the Admin Console to create a custom authenticator.

#### Workaround

Create both the OIDC client app (with a custom `client_id`) and the custom authenticator in the Admin Console.

Alternatively, you can call the `api/v1/apps` endpoint to create the OIDC app and `custom client_id`, and call the `api/v1/authenticators` endpoint to create a custom authenticator.

## Troubleshoot

If your push notifications aren't delivering:

1. Follow the steps to [view push notification events](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-all-notification-services).
2. To narrow your search parameters, enter the following: `eventType eq "device.push.provider.update" and displayMessage eq "Push Provider Configuration verification failed"`. See [Event types](/docs/reference/api/event-types/).
3. In the **Reason** section, locate the error message from your push provider. Consult the push provider documentation, if necessary.
4. Verify that your notification services configuration is valid. See [Edit a notification service](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-all-notification-services).
5. Click **Save** to allow push providers to attempt to send notifications again.
6. If your push notifications still aren't delivering, repeat steps 1-5.
