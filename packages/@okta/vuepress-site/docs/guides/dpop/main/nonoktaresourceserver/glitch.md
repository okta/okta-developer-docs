For instructional purposes, this guide provides example validation in a Node.js Express app using the third-party site Glitch.

Glitch is a browser-based development environment that can build a full-stack web app online. Use the Glitch example to review and quickly implement the validation code. It includes all dependencies required to complete validation.

Copy (remix on Glitch) the [Validation DPoP Tokens](https://glitch.com/~validate-dpop-tokens) Glitch project to have a functional code sample. The validation steps at the beginning of this section are included in the code for quick implementation.
