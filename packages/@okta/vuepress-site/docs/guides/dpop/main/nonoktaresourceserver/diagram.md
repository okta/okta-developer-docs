> **Note:** These steps assume that you've already made a request to the `/authorize` endpoint to obtain the authorization code for the [Authorization Code with PKCE](/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/) flow.

1. Client generates a public/private key pair for use with DPoP.
1. Client adds the public key in the header of the JWT and signs the JWT with the private key.
1. Client adds the JWT to the `DPoP` request header and sends the request to the `/token` endpoint for an access token.
1. The authorization server observes no `nonce` in the DPoP proof, returns an error with the `dpop-nonce` header.
1. Client adds the `nonce` and `jti` values to the JWT payload, updates the request header with the new JWT value, and sends the access token request again.
1. The authorization server binds the public key to the access token and sends the response.
1. Client sends the request for access to the resource and includes the DPoP-bound access token and the DPoP proof JWT in the header.
1. The resource validates the DPoP-bound access token by verifying that the public key of the DPoP proof JWT in the `DPoP` header matches the public key that the access token is bound to. When validation is successful, the resource grants access.
