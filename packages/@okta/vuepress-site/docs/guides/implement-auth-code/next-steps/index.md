When your application passes a request with an `access_token`, the resource server will need to validate it. For more on this, see [Validate Access Tokens](/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/).

### Examples

The following web application examples show you the authorization code flow, as it would be implemented by a web app that needs to authenticate the end user and then create a local session for that user. These projects use popular web frameworks to handle the heavy lifting. Each project can be cloned and ran locally.
