## About the TAC authenticator

TAC is an authenticator that allows a user to authenticate with a temporary access code that’s generated by an admin. It’s commonly used in onboarding or account recovery scenarios. In those scenarios, users might not have access to other authenticators and need temporary access to enroll other authenticators or unlock their account.

After an admin configures the TAC authenticator settings, admins or help-desk agents can generate a TAC. After an admin generates a TAC, they contact the user who needs it and verifies their identity and their need for a TAC. The admin then sends the TAC to the user.

> **Note:** There is no default way to send a TAC to a user. Okta recommends that admins or help-desk agents send a TAC through a secure out-of-band channel. For example, speak to the user directly and tell them the TAC over the phone.

The TAC authenticator is a knowledge factor that can’t satisfy 2 factor type MFA requirements.

## Configure the TAC authenticator

Use the [Create an authenticator](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Authenticator/#tag/Authenticator/operation/createAuthenticator) endpoint to set up TAC as an authenticator.

Create your own POST request body or copy the example request and input your values.

1. Set the following request body parameters:
   1. Set the authenticator `key` as `tac`.
   1. Enter a value for `name`.
   1. Set the provider `type` as `TAC`.
   1. Set the minimum time-to-live (`minTtl`) for the TAC as `10` minutes.
   1. Set the maximum TTL (`maxTtl`) for the TAC as `180` minutes.
   1. Set the default TTL as `120` minutes.
   1. Set the number of characters in the TAC (`length`) as `16`.
   1. Set all the complexity parameters as `true`. This ensures that the TAC includes numbers, letters, and special characters.
      > **Note:** You can’t set numbers as `false`.
   1. Set `multiUseAllowed` as `true`. This means that the TAC can be used multiple times before it expires.
2. Send the `POST /api/v1/authenticators` request.
3. Copy and paste the `id` of the response into a text editor. Use it in the next section.

      },
      "multiUseAllowed": true
    }
  }
}
```

    }
}

### Add TAC to an authenticator enrollment policy

Add the TAC authenticator to an authenticator enrollment policy so that it’s available for use by the test user. Use the [Create a policy](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Policy/#tag/Policy/operation/createPolicy) endpoint.

Use the following request body example to create an authenticator enrollment policy. Before you create the authenticator enrollment policy, use the [List all groups](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups) endpoint to retrieve the group `id` of your test group.

1. Use the standard values and format from the request body example.
1. Ensure the following parameters are set correctly:
1. Under `groups.include` use the group `id` of your test group.
1. In the `settings` property, include the following array:

   ```json
    {
        "key": "tac",
        "enroll": {
            "self": "OPTIONAL"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Send the `POST /api/v1/policies` request.

Users in that group are now able to use the TAC authenticator.

                "enroll": {
                    "self": "REQUIRED"
                }
            },
            {
                "key": "webauthn",
                "enroll": {
                    "self": "OPTIONAL"
                }
            },
            {
                "key": "security_question",
                "enroll": {
                    "self": "OPTIONAL"
                }
            },
             {
                "key": "tac",
                "enroll": {
                    "self": "OPTIONAL"
                }
            }
        ],
            "type": "AUTHENTICATORS"
    }
}
```

## Configure a global session policy for TAC

Create a new global session policy that allows users to authenticate with only the TAC authenticator. See [HOC instructions for creating GSP]()

## Add TAC to an authentication method chain

\<\<\<add step to get to the authentication method chain dialog\>\>\>
Select Password as the first authentication method.
Select Temporary Access Code as the second authentication method.
Select Every time user signs in to resource.
Configure other settings as required.

### Require a temporary access code without a password

\<\<\<add step to get to the authentication method chain dialog\>\>\>
Select Temporary Access Code as the first authentication method.
Select Every time user signs in to resource.
Configure other settings as required.

## Generate a TAC for a user

Use the List all users endpoint to retrieve the id of the user you want to generate a TAC for.

Use the User Authenticator Enrollments API to enroll a TAC for a user. 

Create your own POST request body or copy the example request and input your values.

In the path of the POST request, set the userId as the id from the response of the List all users request.
In the request body, set the following parameters:
Set the authenticatorId as the id from the response of the previous section.
Set the authenticatorType as tac.
Set the TTL of the TAC as 120.
Set multiUse as false. 
Send the POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/authenticatorEnrollments request.

### Create a TAC request example

```json
{
    "authenticatorId": "aut1r7cjnW1uEj64O0g4",
    "authenticatorType": "tac",
    "config": {
        "ttl": 1440,
        "multiUse": false
    }
}
```

  },
