title: Gather information
---
Before you get started, make sure that you have the following information:

* A domain that you own, for example, `example.com`.
* A subdomain that you want to use, for example, `login.example.com`. 
* A valid TLS certificate for your subdomain. If you don't have one, you can generate one with a service such as:
    - [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/)
    - [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

    Make sure that you have the TLS certificate (PEM-encoded) for your subdomain and the 2048-bit private key (PEM-encoded) before beginning.
