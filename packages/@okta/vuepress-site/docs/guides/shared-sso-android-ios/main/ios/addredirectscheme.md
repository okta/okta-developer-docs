To add a redirect scheme for iOS, open `Info.plist` in your application bundle and set a URL Scheme to the scheme of the redirect URI.

For example, if your redirect URI is `com.first.sample:/callback`, the URL Scheme is `com.first.sample`.

> **Note:** When you finish, you can build and run the app.
