Use the sample iOS app that you cloned from GitHub (see the Samples linked at the top of the guide) to test how multiple apps can share a browser session with iOS.

### Install the dependencies
To install the Okta Browser Sign-in sample app dependencies into your project, this guide uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

Enter the following at the command line inside the sample app:

`pod install`

> **Note:** Be sure to work within the Okta BrowserSignIn Workspace in Xcode after you do `pod install`.

### Modify the configuration file
Make the following modifications in the `OktaBrowserSignIn/Okta.plist` file of your sample app:

* `redirectUri`: Enter `com.first.sample:/callback` as the value, which is what you defined as one of the **Sign-in redirect URIs** in the Native app that you created in the [previous step](#configure-two-openid-connect-native-apps).
* `clientId`: Enter the Client ID that you copied during the [previous step](#configure-two-openid-connect-native-apps).
* `issuer`: This is the URL for the authorization server that performs authentication. It's a combination of your `Org URL` and `/oauth2/default`.

    For example: `https//${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default`

> **Note:** You can find the `Org URL`ion the Admin Console's global header in the upper-right corner of the page. Click the section that displays your email and company name.  A drop-down box appears and displays general org information including the full `Org URL` (for example, subdomain.okta.com).

* `logoutRedirectUri`: Enter `com.first.sample:/logout` as the value, which is what you defined as one of the **Sign-out redirect URIs** in the Native app that you created in the [previous step](#configure-two-openid-connect-native-apps).
