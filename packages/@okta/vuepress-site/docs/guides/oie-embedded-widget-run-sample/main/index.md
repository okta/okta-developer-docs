[downloaded and set up the SDK configurations](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/), the next step is to test the Widget sample app.

<StackSelector snippet="testapp" noSelector />

## Start working with the use cases

Now that you have successfully ran the sample app, the next step is to build out your
