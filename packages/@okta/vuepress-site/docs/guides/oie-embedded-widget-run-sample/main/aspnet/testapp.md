The sample app is located here: `okta-idx-dotnet/samples/samples-aspnet/embedded-sign-in-widget`

## Steps to test the sample app

1. If not already done, set up your Okta org by completing the steps located at
   [Set up your Okta org (for password factor only use cases)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-password-factor-only-use-cases).
1. If not already done, [download and set up the sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/).
1. Locate the sample apps solution file in the following path:
`...\okta-idx-dotnet\samples\samples-aspnet\embedded-sign-in-widget`
1. In Visual Studio, open `embedded-sign-in-widget.sln`.
1. Right-click the embedded-sign-in-widget project (the sample app), and select **Set as startup project**.
1. Add a `okta.yaml` configuration file. See [Option 1: YAML configuration file](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/#option-1-configuration-file) for more information on how to configure
   and where to place the configuration file.
1. Click Visual Studio's play button and run the solution. The default web browser should open and navigate to the app's home page. The URL should be `https://localhost:44314`, which is the default address when using IISExpress. After the app loads, click the **Sign In** button located on the home screen.
1. On the sign-in page, enter the username (email) and password that you used in [Create your Okta account](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#create-your-okta-account). The following shows a sample of the sign-in form.

   </div>

1. Sign in to the app. If successful, the app redirects you to the user profile page that displays
   basic user profile and security token information.

## Troubleshooting

* If you get a Null Reference exception when the `IDXClient` is instantiated, ensure that you have properly set up your local configurations. To troubleshoot the error, set the local configurations in the constructor for the `IdxClient` so that you can determine whether the issue originates from the SDK not being able to locate your configurations.

* If the widget doesn't load and instead displays the following error, make sure CORS is enabled:
"There was an unexpected internal error. Please try again."

Follow the steps in [Add a trusted origin and enable CORS](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#step-3-add-a-trusted-origin-and-enable-cors) to make sure CORS is enabled.
