All of our Okta packages for PHP use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Install the following dependencies in your project:

- `composer require okta/jwt-verifier`
- `composer require firebase/php-jwt`

In order for you to use the packages, include the vendor autoload file into your project:

```php
require `/vendor/autoload.php`
```
