title: Before you begin
---
This guide shows you how to add Okta authentication to your API endpoints. When you've finished following the steps, clients will need a token generated by Okta to call your protected endpoints.

These steps apply to back-end APIs that are serving [single-page apps](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/) or [mobile apps](/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/) that use Okta to sign users in. If you are building a web app that is served by a server framework, see [Sign users in to your web app](/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/).

This guide assumes that you:

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an existing app, or are new to building apps, start with this documentation:
