The [Golang getting started guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) teaches you how to get started with Golang and create your first app.

Or, if you want to skip this guide and just download a working sample app, download our [Go Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/samples-golang/tree/develop/resource-server).
