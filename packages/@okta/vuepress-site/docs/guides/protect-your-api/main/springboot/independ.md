If you created your application with the Spring Initializr (see Sample code above), this dependency has already been added.

For existing applications, you can add the Okta Spring Boot Starter by including the following Apache Maven dependency: 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```
