1. Create an Okta org and configure it as described in [Set up your Okta org for a password factor only use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-password-factor-only-use-case).
1. [Set up the SDK and Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/nodejs/main/)
1. Build an app with the embedded Sign-in Widget or SDK.
    * For Sign-in Widget based apps, implement [Basic sign-in flow](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-basic-sign-in/nodejs/main/).
    * For SDK based apps, implement [User password recovery](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-pwd-recovery-mfa/nodejs/main/).
1. If you want to test the flows without building an app, use the provided sample apps, which have prebuilt support for password recovery email customizations.
