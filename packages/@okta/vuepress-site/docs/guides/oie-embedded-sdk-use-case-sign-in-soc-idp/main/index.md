> **Note:** In proxy model architectures, where a server-side application using the Embedded SDK is used as a proxy between client applications and Okta servers, a request context for the client applications is required. Security enforcement is expected to be based on the client request contextâ€™s IP address and user agent. However, since these values are currently being derived from the server application rather than the client, this enforcement is not available. As a result, network zones or behaviors that drive their conditions based on these request context values (geolocation, IP Address, or user agent) will not work until we can find a solution to the issue.

This guide covers a sequence of steps that you can follow to build an app that allows users to sign in with the Facebook social Identity Provider.

**Learning outcomes**

Set up your Okta org and app to support sign-in with Facebook IdP use cases.

**What you need**

* An app that uses the embedded Okta Identity Engine SDK
* [Okta org already set up for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case)
* [Identity Engine SDK set up for your own app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/)

## Configuration updates

Before you build the Facebook IdP sign-in flow, ensure that you've [set up your app for a password factor only use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-password-factor-only-use-case) and [set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/-/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case).
