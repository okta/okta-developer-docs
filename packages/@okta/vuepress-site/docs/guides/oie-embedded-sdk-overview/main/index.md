This guide walks you through the steps to download, set up, and configure
the SDK. It also provides you with a sample app that you can use to learn about the SDK and integrate it into your app. After you complete the initial steps, you can walk through the available use cases that highlight the supported features such as sign-in, multifactor authentication, and self-registration.

## The SDK flow

The SDK integrates into your app by using a native language interface and communicates directly with Okta APIs by using a REST interface. The following is a summary of the SDK flow.
