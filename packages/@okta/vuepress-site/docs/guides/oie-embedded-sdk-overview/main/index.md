This guide walks you through the steps to download, set up, and configure
the SDK and provided sample application. After you complete the initial steps,
you are ready to walk through the available use cases that highlight
the supported features such as sign in, multifactor authentication, and
self-registration.

Use the sample application as your guide when learning about and integrating the SDK
into your application.

## Why you would want to use the embedded SDK

There are several reasons why you would choose the embedded SDK to help you build out
your identity solution:

* Allow for a fully customized user experience
* Easy to code against a high level SDK interface
* Greater flexibility to solve your specific branding requirements

For a full list of reasons and a complete overview of the different deployment
models see
[Embedded vs redirect authentication](/docs/concepts/hosted-vs-embedded/#okta-hosted-vs-customer-hosted).

## The SDK flow

The SDK integrates into your application using a native language
interface and communicates directly with the Okta APIs using a
REST interface. The flow is summarized below:
