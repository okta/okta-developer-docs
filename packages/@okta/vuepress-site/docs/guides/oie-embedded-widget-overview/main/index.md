This document describes how to integrate user sign in other features
into your app using Oktaâ€™s embedded widget. Most of the code
samples in this guide are derived from the included sample application that
is provided with the Widget.

## Why you would want to use the embedded widget

Several reasons why you would choose the embedded Widget include:

* Easy and quick integration
* Most features are out of the box ready
* Most functionality such as multi-factor authentication is purely
   a configuration change with no additional code

## The widget flow

In tandem with the embedded SDK, the widget integrates into your
app using a native language interface and communicates directly with
the Okta APIs. The flow is summarized below:
