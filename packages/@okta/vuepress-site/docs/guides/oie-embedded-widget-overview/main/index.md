This document describes how to integrate other user sign-in features into your app by using Okta's embedded Sign-In Widget. Most of the code samples in this guide are derived from the sample application that is provided with the widget.

## The widget flow

In tandem with the embedded SDK, the widget integrates into your app by using a native language interface and communicates directly with the Okta APIs. The following summarizes the flow.
