This document describes how to integrate other user sign-in features into your app by using Okta's embedded widget. Most of the code samples in this guide are derived from the sample application that is provided with the Widget.

## Why use the embedded widget?

You would most likely use the embedded widget primarily for these reasons:

* Quick and easy integration
* Most features are ready out of the box.
* Most functionalities, such as multi-factor authentication, are merely a configuration change with no additional code.

## The widget flow

In tandem with the embedded SDK, the widget integrates into your app by using a native language interface and communicates directly with the Okta APIs. The following summarizes the flow.

## Get started on using the widget

To start using the widget:

1. If not already done, [create your account and set up your okta org](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/).
1. If not already done, [download and set up the SDK and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/).
1. [Run the widget sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-run-sample/aspnet/main/).
1. With the sample app as your guide, integrate the SDK into your app by using the available
   [use cases](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-overview/).
