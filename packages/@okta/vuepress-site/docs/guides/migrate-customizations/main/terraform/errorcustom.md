Error pages are managed through the [Custom Pages API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/CustomPages/). Terraform support for custom error page content is limited.

For most use cases, error page branding is controlled through the theme resource (colors, logos, and so on) rather than custom HTML.
