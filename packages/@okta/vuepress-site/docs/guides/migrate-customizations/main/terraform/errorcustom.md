# Note: Custom error page HTML content cannot be modified if multibrand
# customization is enabled in your org.
#
# Error pages are managed through the Custom Pages API, but Terraform
# support for custom error page content is limited.
#
# For most use cases, error page branding is controlled through the
# theme resource (colors, logos, etc.) rather than custom HTML.
