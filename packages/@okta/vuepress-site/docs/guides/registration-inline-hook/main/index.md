<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

This guide provides working examples of an Okta registration inline hook for self-service registration (SSR) and Progressive Enrollment support. It uses the web site [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) to act as an external service to receive and respond to registration inline hook calls.

> **Note:** This document is only for Okta Identity Engine. If youâ€™re using Okta Classic Engine, see [Registration inline hook for Classic Engine](/docs/guides/archive-registration-inline-hook/nodejs/main/). See [Identify your Okta solution](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-oie-version) to determine your Okta version.

## About registration inline hook implementation

In the following examples, the external service code parses requests from Okta and responds with commands that indicate the following:

* Whether the end user's email domain is valid and allowed to register (for SSR)
* Whether the end user's employee number is valid and allowed to be added to their profile (for Progressive Enrollment support)

In these examples, you set up your registration inline hook to handle both SSR and Progressive Enrollment support. It is possible to configure one workflow and not the other. However, by configuring both, you need to set up your code to handle the requests of each workflow. When the end user attempts to self-register or update their profile, Okta dynamically detects the request type. See [Enable the registration inline hook](#enable-the-registration-inline-hook).

The following is a high-level workflow for an SSR inline hook:

1. An end user attempts to self-register with your Okta org.
1. A registration inline hook triggers during this process and sends a call to the external service with the end user's data.
1. The external service evaluates the Okta call to ensure that the end user is from domain `example.com`.
1. The external service responds to Okta with a command to allow or deny the registration based on the email domain.

The following is a high-level workflow for a progressive enrollment inline hook:

1. An existing registered end user attempts to sign in to their profile.
1. A profile enrollment policy presents a custom form that asks for additional data from the end user.
1. A registration inline hook triggers during this process and sends a call to the external service with the end user's data.
1. The external service responds to Okta with a command to allow or deny the addition of the new data to the end user's profile.

## SSR request

The following is an example of a JSON request received from Okta. The request properties contain data submitted by the end user who is trying to self register.

See the [request properties](/docs/reference/registration-hook/#objects-in-the-request-from-okta) of a registration inline hook for full details.

    }
}
```

## Send response

The external service responds to Okta indicating whether to accept the end user's self-registration or profile update. The response returns a `commands` object in the body of the HTTPS response. This object contains specific syntax that indicates whether the user is allowed or denied to self-register or to update their profile with Okta.

In our sample Glitch project, you can see this response in the [server.js](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/okta-registration-inline-hook-sample?path=server.js%3A1%3A0) file.

See the [response properties](/docs/reference/registration-hook/#response-objects-that-you-send) of a registration inline hook for full details.

## Set up, activate, and enable

You must set up, activate, and enable the registration inline hook within your Okta Admin Console.

### Set up your Glitch project

You need to remix your own version of the Okta sample Glitch project and confirm that it is live.

1. Go to the [Okta Registration Inline Hook Example](https://glitch.com/~okta-inlinehook-registrationhook-v2).
1. Click **Remix your own**.
1. Click **Share**.
1. In the **Live site** field, click the copy icon. This is your external service URL. Make a note of it as you need it later.
1. Update the project with your own code. For example, you can use the [Send response](#send-response) sample in the `server.js` file.

### Set up and activate the registration inline hook

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Workflow** > **Inline Hooks**.
1. Click **Add Inline Hook** and select **Registration** from the dropdown menu.
1. Add a name for the hook (in this example, use "Guide Registration Hook Code").
1. Add your external service URL (see [Set up your Glitch project](#set-up-your-glitch-project)), and append it with the endpoint. For example, use your Glitch project name with the endpoint (`registrationHook`):

   `https://your-glitch-projectname.glitch.me/registrationHook`

1. Include the authentication field and secret. In this example:

   * **Authentication Field** = `authorization`
   * **Authorization Secret** = `Basic YWRtaW46c3VwZXJzZWNyZXQ=`

   > **Note**: If you want to use OAuth 2.0 to secure your inline hooks, see [Add Authentication method](/docs/guides/common-hook-set-up-steps/nodejs/main/#add-authentication-method).

1. Click **Save**.
1. In your Glitch project, click **Logs**. If your set up is successful, a "Your app is listening on port {XXXX}" message appears.

The registration inline hook is now set up with an active status.

> **Note:** You can also set up an inline hook using the API. See [Inline Hooks Management API](/docs/reference/api/inline-hooks/#create-inline-hook).

### Set up the employee number attribute

In the Progressive Enrollment example, end users are asked to submit a valid employee number. The `employeeNumber` attribute is read-only by default. You need to change `employeeNumber` to read-write.

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Directory** > **Profile Editor**.
1. Select **User (default)**.
1. Under **Attributes**, find **Employee Number** and click the information icon.
1. In the **Employee Number** dialog, under **User permission**, select **Read-Write**.
1. Click **Save Attribute**.

End users can now update the employee number in their profile.

### Enable the registration inline hook

To enable the registration inline hook, you must associate it with a Profile Enrollment policy. In this example, you create an enrollment policy specifically for your hook. See [enable and configure a Profile Enrollment policy](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-profile-enrollment).

> **Note:** Profile Enrollment and registration inline hooks are only supported by the [Okta Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/embedded-siw/) version 4.5 or later.

To associate the registration inline hook with a Profile Enrollment policy:

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Security > Profile Enrollment**.
1. Click **Add Profile Enrollment Policy**.
1. Give your policy a name (in this example, use "Inline Hook"), and then click **Save**.
1. From the list of Enrollment Policies, find **Inline Hook** and click the pencil icon.
1. Click **Manage Apps**, and then click **Add Apps to this Policy**.
1. Locate the **Okta Admin Console**, click **Apply**, and then click **Close**.
1. Click **Back to Profile Enrollment Policy**.
1. In **Profile enrollment**, click **Edit**.
1. For **Self-service registration**, select **Allowed**.
1. From the **Inline hook** dropdown menu, select the hook that you set up and activated earlier. See [Set up and activate the registration inline hook](#set-up-and-activate-the-registration-inline-hook).

   > **Note:** You can associate only one inline hook at a time with your Profile Enrollment policy.

1. In **Run this hook**, select **Both**. For our examples, this trigger allows both an SSR request and a Progressive Enrollment data update request.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Under **Profile Enrollment Form**, click **Add form input**.
1. From the dropdown menu, select **Employee number**.
1. In the **Add form input** dialog, under **Customize form input**, set **Input requirement** as **Optional**.
1. Click **Save**.

Your registration inline hook is configured for Profile Enrollment. You are now ready to preview and test the example.

## Preview the registration inline hook

Your Okta org is set up to call the sample external service using a registration inline hook, and the external service is ready to receive and respond to an Okta call.

In your Okta org, you can preview the request and response JSON in the Admin Console.

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Workflow** > **Inline Hooks**.
1. Select the registration inline hook name (in this example, select **Guide Registration Hook Code**).
1. Click **Preview**.
1. In the **Configure Inline Hook request** block, select an end user from your org in the **data.userProfile** field. That is, select a value from your `data.user.profile` object.
1. To test an SSR request, under **requestType**, select **Self-Service Registration**.
1. From the **Preview example Inline Hook request** block, select **Generate Request**.
   The end user's request information in JSON format, that is sent to the external service, appears.
1. Click **Edit** to update your request before previewing the response. For this example, change the email domain to `@example.com`.
1. From the **View service's response** block, click **View Response**.
   The response from your external service in JSON format appears, which indicates that self-registration was either allowed or denied.
1. To test a profile update, select an end user from your org in the **data.userProfile** field, and then under **requestType** select **Progressive Profile**.
1. From the **Preview example Inline Hook request** block, select **Generate Request**.
1. Click **Edit** to update `userProfileUpdate`:
   ```javascript
   "userProfileUpdate": {
      "employeeNumber": "1234"
      }
   ```
   > **Note:** Make sure that you delete the comma after the value you enter for an employee number. It isn't valid JSON otherwise.
1. From the **View service's response** block, click **View Response**.
   The response from your external service in JSON format appears, which indicates that the profile update was either allowed or denied.

## Test

You can also test the code directly with self-registering or profile-updating end users.

### Test the SSR inline hook

To run a test of your SSR inline hook, go to the Okta sign-in page for your Okta org, click the **Sign Up** link, and attempt to self-register.
> **Note:** The **Employee number** field appears as optional. To test SSR, you can leave **Employee number** blank.

* If you use an allowable email domain, such as `rosario.jones@example.com`, the end user registration goes through.
* If you use an incorrect email domain, the end user registration is denied. Review the error message that displays the error summary from the external service code and is passed back to Okta. See [error](/docs/reference/registration-hook/#error).

### Test the progressive enrollment inline hook

To test the progressive enrollment inline hook, you need to make **Employee number** required and manually add a user with a password.

1. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console as an admin.
1. Go to **Security** > **Profile Enrollment**.
1. Under **Profile enrollment form**, find **Employee number**, and then click **Edit**.
1. Set the **Input requirement** to **Required**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Go to **Directory** > **People**, and then click **Add person**.
1. Enter the credentials for your test user and select **I will set password**.
1. Enter a password, and then click **Save**.
1. Sign out from the Admin Console and sign in with your new `@example.com` credentials.

* If you use valid sign-in credentials, the **Employee number** field appears on the next page.
* If you enter an employee number in a valid format (4 digits), the update goes through.
* If you enter an employee number in an invalid format, the update is denied. Review the error message that displays the error summary from the external service code and is passed back to Okta. See [error](/docs/reference/registration-hook/#error).

> **Note:** Review [Troubleshooting hook implementations](/docs/guides/common-hook-set-up-steps/nodejs/main/#troubleshoot-hook-implementations) for help with any difficulties during setup or configuration.
