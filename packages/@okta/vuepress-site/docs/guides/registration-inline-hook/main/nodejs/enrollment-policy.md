To enable the registration inline hook, you must associate it with a profile enrollment policy. In this example, you create an enrollment policy specifically for your hook. See [enable and configure a profile enrollment policy](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-profile-enrollment).

> **Note:** Profile Enrollment and registration inline hooks are only supported by the [Okta Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/embedded-siw/) version 4.5 or later.
