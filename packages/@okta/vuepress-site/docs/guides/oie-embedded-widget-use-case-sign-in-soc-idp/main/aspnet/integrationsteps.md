### 1: The user selects the Facebook Identity Provider

After you complete the steps in [Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case), the **Sign in with Facebook** link should appear automatically on the Widget. You don't need to make any code changes to make the link appear.

When the user clicks this link, they are sent to the Facebook login screen.

### 2: The user signs in to Facebook

The user enters their email and password, and clicks **Log In**. This page is hosted by Facebook. The user information that you enter originates from a test user that you configured in [Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case). You don't need to make any code changes in your app to support this step.

### 3: Redirect the request to the Okta org

If the user's Facebook login is successful, Facebook routes the user to the value that you entered for **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** and **Site URL** in [Create a Facebook app in Facebook](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#_1-create-a-facebook-app-in-facebook). The value takes on the following format: `https://{Okta org domain}/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`, for example, `https://dev-12345678.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`)

### 4: Redirect the request to the client

After Facebook sends the success login request to your Okta org, the org redirects the request to your app through the Application's **Sign-in redirect URIs** field.

This step handles the callback from the Widget that returns an `interaction_code`. This code is redeemed in the next step for tokens. The callback URL must be identical and is defined in these two locations:

* The `RedirectURI` parameter in the configuration setting that is defined in [Download and set up the SDK and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/).
* A URI defined in the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field in the Okta Application. The **Sign-in redirect URIs** field is described in [Create a new application](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#create-a-new-application).

For the sample application, the **RedirectURI** should be set to `https://localhost:44314/interactioncode/callback`.

The sample application uses the MVC architecture and defines the following `Callback` function in the `InteractionCodeController` controller to handle the callback.

```csharp
public async Task<ActionResult> Callback(string state = null, string interaction_code = null, string error = null, string error_description = null)
{

}
```

### 5: Get the tokens

The next step is to call `RedeemInteractionCodeAsync` inside the callback function for the `IdxClient`. The Interaction Code is used to get the ID and access tokens that you can subsequently use to pull user information.

```csharp
Okta.Idx.Sdk.TokenResponse tokens = await _idxClient.RedeemInteractionCodeAsync(idxContext, interaction_code);
```

### 6: Persist the tokens in a session

Persist the tokens in session for future use. The following code below from the sample application uses
`IAuthenticationManager` from `Microsoft.Owin.Security` to persist these tokens in session.

```csharp
ClaimsIdentity identity = await AuthenticationHelper.GetIdentityFromTokenResponseAsync(_idxClient.Configuration, tokens);
_authenticationManager.SignIn(new AuthenticationProperties { IsPersistent = false }, identity);
```

### 7 (Optional): Get user profile information

Depending on your implementation, you can choose to pull user information. When you use the tokens that are provided by the `RedeemInteractionCodeAsync` method, you can request the user profile information from the `v1/userinfo` endpoint.
The following code from the sample app provides details on this call.

```csharp
public static async Task<IEnumerable<Claim>> GetClaimsFromUserInfoAsync(IdxConfiguration configuration, string accessToken)
{
    Uri userInfoUri = new Uri(IdxUrlHelper.GetNormalizedUriString(configuration.Issuer,
       "v1/userinfo"));
    HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
    var userInfoResponse = await httpClient.GetUserInfoAsync(new UserInfoRequest
           {
                Address = userInfoUri.ToString(),
                Token = accessToken,
           }).ConfigureAwait(false);
   var nameClaim = new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, userInfoResponse.Claims.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Type
            == "name")?.Value);
   return userInfoResponse.Claims.Append(nameClaim);
}
```
