title: Build the request
---
After you define the scopes that you want to require consent for, prepare an authentication or authorization request with the correct values.

1. Obtain the following values from your OpenID Connect application, both of which can be found on the application's **General** tab:

    * Client ID
    * Redirect URI

2. Use the default Custom Authorization Server's authorization endpoint:

    > **Note:** See [Authorization Servers](/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/overview/) for more information on the types of authorization servers available to you and what you can use them for.

    A default Custom Authorization endpoint looks like this where the `${authServerId}` is `default`:

        `https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize`

3. Add the following query parameters to the URL:

    * Your OpenID Connect application's `client_id` and `redirect_uri`
    * The `openid` scope and the scopes that you want to require consent for. In this example, we configured the `phone` scope in the <GuideLink link="../require-consent">previous section</GuideLink>.
    * The response type, which for an ID token is `id_token` and an access token is `token`

    > **Note:** The examples in this guide use the [Implicit flow](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#implicit-flow), which streamlines authentication by returning tokens without introducing additional steps. This makes it easier to test your configuration. For the [Authorization Code flow](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#authorization-code-flow), the response type is `code`. You can then exchange an authorization code for an ID token and/or an access token using the `/token` endpoint.

    * Values for `state` and `nonce`, which can be anything

    * Optional. The `prompt` parameter. The standard behavior (if you don't include `prompt` in the request) is to prompt the user for consent if they haven't already given consent for the scope(s). When you include `prompt=consent` in the request, the user is prompted for consent every time, even if they have already given consent. The `consent_method` and the consent for the scope(s) must be set to `REQUIRED`. See the [**Parameter details**](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#parameter-details) section for the `/authorize` endpoint for more information on the supported values for the `prompt` parameter.

    > **Note:** All of the values are fully documented in the `/authorize` [endpoint](/docs/reference/api/oidc/#authorize) section of the OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 API reference.

    The resulting URL to request an access token looks something like this:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET
    "https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/${authServerId}/v1/authorize?client_id=examplefa39J4jXdcCwWA
    &response_type=token
    &scope=openid%20phone
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FyourRedirectUriHere.com
    &state=myState
    &nonce=${myNonceValue}"
    ```

    Example with the `prompt` parameter included:

     ```bash
    curl -X GET
    "https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/${authServerId}/v1/authorize?client_id=examplefa39J4jXdcCwWA
    &response_type=token
    &scope=openid%20phone
    &prompt=consent
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FyourRedirectUriHere.com
    &state=myState
    &nonce=${myNonceValue}"
    ```

    > **Note:** The `response_type` for an ID token looks like this: `&response_type=id_token`.

4. Paste the request URL into a browser. The User Consent dialog box appears. Click **Allow** to create the grant.

    > **Note:** The user only has to grant consent once for an attribute per authorization server.
