title: Specify your integration settings
---

This portion of the guide takes you through the steps for configuring your specific SSO integration using the Okta Admin Console.

After you create your integration in the <GuideLink link="../create-your-app">previous</GuideLink> task, the Admin Console opens the main settings page for your new integration. In here, you can specify **General Settings** and **Sign On** options, as well as assign the integration to users in your org. Click **Edit** if you need to change any of the options, and **Save** when you have made your changes.
