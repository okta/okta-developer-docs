### Troubleshoot SAML issues

If you run into issues with your sign-in process, you can try the following to troubleshoot the issues:

* Use the [Okta SAML validation tool](http://saml.oktadev.com/) to speed up the process of developing a SAML SP.
  This tool makes it easy for you to send SAML Requests to your SAML SP. It allows you to quickly change the contents of the SAML requests and simplifies the process of debugging SAML issues by automatically decoding SAML payloads and displaying server headers for you.
* You can also install the [SAML Tracer extension to Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saml-tracer/) for testing, or similar tools for other browsers.
* Post your questions on the [Okta Developer Forum](https://devforum.okta.com/search?q=saml) or on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=saml+okta).
