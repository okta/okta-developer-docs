The Client Credentials flow is recommended for use in machine-to-machine authentication. Your application will need to securely store its Client ID and Secret and pass those to Okta in exchange for an access token. At a high-level, the flow only has two steps:

- Your application passes its client credentials to your Okta authorization server.
- If the credentials are accurate, Okta responds with an access token.
