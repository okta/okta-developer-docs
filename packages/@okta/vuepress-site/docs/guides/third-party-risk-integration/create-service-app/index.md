title: Create a service app for third-party risk provider
---

Your Okta org requires the set up of an OAuth service application to integrate and consume risk events from a third-party risk provider.

Use the following high-level steps to configure this service application:

1. [Create a public-private key pair](/docs/guides/third-party-risk-integration/create-service-app/#create-a-public-private-key-pair)
2. [Create and verify the service application](/docs/guides/third-party-risk-integration/create-service-app/#create-a-service-application)
3. [Add a scope grant to the service application](/docs/guides/third-party-risk-integration/create-service-app/#add-scope-grant-to-application)

For information on this general process, see [Implement OAuth for Okta with a Service App](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/overview/).

### Create a public-private key pair

Prior to creating the service application for the third-party risk provider, you need to create a public-private key pair for client authentication. Use a tool such as the [JSON Web Key Generator](https://mkjwk.org/) to generate  a public-private key pair for an example setup.

1. Navigate to [JSON Web Key Generator](https://mkjwk.org/).
2. Use the following values when generating the pair:

    - **Key Size**: 2048
    - **Key Use**: Signature
    - **Algorithm**: RS256
    - **Key ID**: SHA-256
    - **Show X.509**: No

3. Click **Generate**. A sample **Public Key** value follows:

    ```JSON
    {
    "kty": "RSA",
    "e": "AQAB",
    "use": "sig",
    "kid": "NhIpAobkW_7CfLFA2d1UUB8odnWbZMebCR8dm-O6aMM",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "n": "pqEM9uy9rPs6M8E3zGqnSjdgHRYj9pZ2LCb0sRzpg2r1BItPXknLPmrcVI0K4a84FpDRRoOc5zV-YILYIPA8JdAnazQiiGHfzzrNsTfcT-iD45-4Fb7tyuU2KQdwwZpP0FfWNcILgbdJbYdjfPM7AuKg3zok7xzZnk-wTJkGzdcya-0X5jX4hKl48hm8506CBep6fKhwZbjMXTt3R2bm-zqxYqjC5dXawx0ICniRnZyzNscmO6e3SYd0WDB-etQTHehbj1r0v6NOVZBWwsQEMP7_WZoUUS02mOODYSh-TI-deJ3Aw61iG5rKsQDgOZzGy2ZazyXJGhhfngGgzL4xfw"
    }
    ```
4. Copy the **Public Key** JSON value to your Postman environment's `publicKey` variable.
5. Make sure to save the JSON value for the **Public and Private Keypair**, which is required during testing.

For background information on this process, see [Create a public/private key pair](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/create-publicprivate-keypair).

### Create a service application

Create the service application that integrates with the third-party risk provider using the previously generated public key for authentication.

1. Copy the name of your third-party risk provider to your Postman environment's `providerName` variable. In this example, use `Risk Provider Example`. Save the environment.

2. Call the following POST API from the Risk Integration Postman collection: **Admin: API to create OAuth service client (for the provider)** (`{{url}}/oauth2/v1/clients`).

3. Review the response, which includes the `jwks` key pair. Note, the `client_name` value is the same value you gave as the `providerName` variable. A sample response follows:

    ```JSON
    {
    "client_id": "0oaaaboyxsbrWdsk81d6",
    "client_id_issued_at": 1611263018,
    "client_name": "Risk Provider Example",
    "client_uri": null,
    "logo_uri": null,
    "redirect_uris": [
        "https://httpbin.org/get"
    ],
    "response_types": [
        "token"
    ],
    "grant_types": [
        "client_credentials"
    ],
    "jwks": {
        "keys": [
            {
                "kty": "RSA",
                "alg": "RS256",
                "kid": null,
                "use": "sig",
                "e": "AQAB",
                "n": "uNj5u6PSWYR0VOTEhVsVEMfiFCVcNBKyRGM0YHQjGlhEHO-28Dw68l8U1KdHdiNVrvL21S-bfQFyQWSTF5_w5x966SmNMPHtjkxoJ_BOxyed3bKkbfLZgq8GM5lsAwTE-NIbMmPciX9Z4VEapaiKbEqg3KSGVzJcEH18E8AiIMgQ0ts7NTJ33sOwtqdTsQfho5crqtPIy1Z0Svvraq-UA7-elDWj9duqLE-YIRx-6U9hdBJ5Q7bC12H_TwcyNoLLwvtdi2X8NNV93CLJ1xoDAS9o8FDmWWUqciXq4XLww1kJRFvOMMT7LLefYdhV1Ef7MTZrpTOlwoDfDDdltTUUmw"
            }
        ]
    },
    "token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt",
    "application_type": "service"
    }
    ```

4. From the response, copy the `client_id` value, in this example `0oaaaboyxsbrWdsk81d6`, to your Postman environment's `clientId` variable. Save the environment.

5. Verify the application is available by calling the following GET API from the Risk Integration Postman collection: **Admin: API to get all OAuth service clients** (`{{url}}/oauth2/v1/clients`).

This call retrieves all service applications from your Okta org, including the new Risk Integration service application.

For background information on this process, see [Create a service app and grant scopes](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/create-serviceapp-grantscopes/).

### Add scope grant to application

You must now define the allowed Risk scope for use with the third-party risk provider service application.

1. Call the following POST API from the Risk Integration Postman collection: **Admin: API to grant scopes to the OAuth service client** (`/api/v1/apps/${clientId}/grants`).

    This call adds the `scopeId` to  the value of: `okta.riskEvents.manage`.

2. Review the response for this addition. A sample portion of the response follows:

    ```JSON
     "_embedded": {
        "scope": {
            "id": "okta.riskEvents.manage"
        }
    },
    ```

For background information on granting scopes, see [Grant allowed scopes](/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/create-serviceapp-grantscopes/#grant-allowed-scopes).

>**Note:** If you get a "Resource Not Found" exception in this step, it's possible that your `clientId` or the URL are not valid.
