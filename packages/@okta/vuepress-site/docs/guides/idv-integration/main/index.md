## About identity verification and IDV vendors

IDV vendors typically verify the identities of users by requiring them to submit a proof of identity. The proof of identity matches a user’s digital identity against a trusted data source. IDV vendors provide IDV flows as part of their services. Okta admins and developers can work with IDV vendors to integrate their IDV flows into their orgs.

IDV flows are customizable and can be configured in different ways to verify user identities. For example, IDV vendors can provide a flow that requires a user’s given and family names to be matched against a picture of their driver’s license or passport. Or they can provide a flow that requires users to take selfies as proofs of liveliness.

### Okta supported IDV vendors

Okta supports three IDV vendors that admins can configure in the [Admin Console](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=id-verification) or by using [Okta APIs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProvider/#tag/IdentityProvider/operation/createIdentityProvider). Use this guide to integrate IDV vendors other than the ones listed here.

</div>

1. An Okta user does one of the following actions to trigger an [Okta account management policy](/docs/guides/okta-account-management-policy/main) evaluation:
   * Enrolls or unenrolls an authenticator
   * Recovers their password
   * Unlocks their account

1. Okta then sends a `POST /oauth2/par` request to the IDV vendor's authorization server.
1. The IDV vendor processes the request and sends a response to Okta with a `request_uri`.
1. Okta receives the `request_uri` and uses it to construct a `GET /oauth2/authorize` request.
1. Okta redirects the `request_uri` to the user's browser. The user's browser sends the GET request to the IDV vendor's authorization endpoint to start the IDV flow. The GET request contains the `request_uri` parameter.
1. The user then completes the IDV flow, and the IDV vendor creates an `authorization_code` and returns it to Okta in a response.
1. Okta creates and sends a `POST /token` request to the IDV vendor that contains information from the redirect response.
1. The IDV vendor sends an `id_token` containing the results of the flow back to Okta.
1. Okta evaluates the results and completes the policy evaluation. The policy evaluation is marked as `VERIFIED` or `FAILED`.

## Summary of steps

The following sections detail the steps of an IDV vendor integration.

### Policy evaluation

A user triggers an Okta account management policy evaluation. There are several ways to trigger a policy evaluation:

* A user enrolls or unenrolls an authenticator
* A user recovers their password
* A user unlocks their account

### POST /oauth2/par request to IDV vendor

After the user triggers a policy evaluation, Okta sends a `POST /oauth2/par` request to the IDV vendor's authorization server.

The request contains standard pushed authorization request (PAR) [parameters](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9126.html#name-pushed-authorization-reques) and a `verified_claims` object. The `verified_claims` object contains two identity verification objects that determine how the IDV flow interacts with Okta.

* The `claims` object passes the information about the Okta user to the IDV vendor.
* The `verification` object determines the trust framework between Okta and the IDV vendor and the necessary assurance level for a successful IDV flow. `IDV-DELEGATED` is the only trust framework that Okta supports for IDV vendor integration.

When Okta sends the request, a unique verification session is established.

#### POST /oauth2/par error response

The error response for an unsuccessful `POST /oauth2/par` request uses this [structure](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9126.html#name-error-response).

```json
 HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 Content-Type: application/json
 Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store

 {
   "error": "invalid_request",
   "error_description":
     "The redirect_uri is not valid for the given client"
 }
```

#### Request parameters

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                     | Param Type | DataType |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|

### IDV vendor responds with request_uri

A successful `POST /oauth2/par` request generates a `request_uri` that's sent back to Okta as a response. The `request_uri` encodes the identity verification attributes of the `POST /oauth2/par` request as a reference to the now established verification session.

#### POST /oauth2/par response example

```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store

{
  "request_uri": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:6esc_11ACC5bwc014ltc14eY22c",
  "expires_in": 60
}
```

### Okta redirects GET /oauth2/authorize request to user

Okta uses the `request_uri` in the IDV vendor response and constructs a `GET /oauth2/authorize` request. Okta then redirects the `request_uri`, that now contains the `GET /oauth2/authorize` request, to the user's browser.

### User's browser sends GET /oauth2/authorize request to IDV vendor

The user's browser sends the GET request to the IDV vendor's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint. The IDV vendor evaluates the `request_uri` so that the IDV flow can start.

> **Note:** For IDV vendors, Okta recommends renaming the authorization endpoint so that it's clear the endpoint is used for identity verification. For example, rename the endpoint to `/oauth2/idv-authorize`.

#### GET /oauth2/authorize request example

```bash
curl -L -X GET "https://idv-vendor.com/oauth2/idv-authorize?request_uri=urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:6esc_11ACC5bwc014ltc14eY22c"
```

#### GET /oauth2/authorize error response

The error response for an unsuccessful `GET /oauth2/authorize` request uses this [structure](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1).

```json
HTTP/1.1 302
GET /idp/identity-verification/callback?error=invalid_request&state=30pqcSFzH7H0bIftWwYRbNNwbpOpfY-W
```

### User completes the IDV flow

The user is then redirected to the IDV vendor app to complete the IDV flow.

### IDV vendor sends authorization_code to Okta

After the user completes the IDV flow, the IDV vendor redirects them to the `redirect_uri` specified in the `POST /oauth2/par` [request](#post-oauth2-par-request-to-idv-vendor). The user is redirected to their Okta org. The `redirect_uri` contains an `authorization_code` that’s redeemed at the `/oauth2/token` endpoint to retrieve the IDV flow results.

#### IDV vendor redirect to Okta example

```bash
curl -L -X GET "https://{yourOktadomain}/idp/identity-verification/callback?code=42bbe6319f0b04a43d&state=30pqcSFzH7H0bIftWwYRbNNwbpOpfY-W"
```

### Okta sends a POST /token request to IDV vendor

Okta receives the `authorization_code` from the IDV vendor. Okta then uses it to construct and send a `POST /token` request to the IDV vendor. The request contains a `code_verifier` value that’s compared against the `code_challenge` value provided in the `POST /oauth2/par` [request](#post-oauth2-par-request-to-idv-vendor). The values must match for the `POST /token` request to succeed.

#### POST /token request example

```bash
curl -L -X POST "https://idv-vendor.com/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id={client_id}" \
  --data-urlencode "client_secret={client_secret}" \
  --data-urlencode "code=42bbe6319f0b04a43d" \
  --data-urlencode "code_verifier=72e0dca42dd87b345f0652899cba4f92e7b9bb2422f7c5a301ffae41" \
  --data-urlencode "redirect_uri=https://{yourOktadomain}/idp/identity-verification/callback"
```

#### POST /token error response

The error response for an unsuccessful `POST /token` request uses this [structure](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenErrorResponse).

```json
 HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 Content-Type: application/json
 Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store

 {
   "error": "invalid_request",
   "error_description":
     "The request is missing a required parameter"
 }
```

### IDV vendor responds with id_token

When the `POST /token` request succeeds, the IDV vendor sends an `id_token` in a JSON Web Token (JWT) encoded format back to Okta in response. The `id_token` includes the `verified_claims` object. This object contains the results of the identity verification for the user.

Note the following the ways to format the `claims` object for the `id_token` response:

* IDV vendors must not include any `claims` attributes other than the [currently supported ones](#supported-oidc-claims). Okta fails a policy evaluation that returns `claims` attributes other than the supported ones.

* IDV vendors can choose to return a `MATCHED` value for any `claims` attributes, instead of returning identifying information about a user. Returning a `MATCHED` value still indicates that the verification was successful but doesn't require IDV vendors to pass identifying information of a user.

* IDV vendors can choose to not pass any `claims` values. They can pass `claims` as an empty object. See [Minimum conformant](https://openid.bitbucket.io/ekyc/openid-ida-verified-claims.html#name-minimum-conformant).

> **Note:** If an IDV vendor passes an empty `claims` object, then the `user.identity_verification` event marks all claims as verified or failed. Whether the claims are failed or verified depends on the `assurance_level` value that's passed.

#### IDV vendor id_token response example

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store

{
  "id_token": {
    "verified_claims": [
      "verification": {
        "trust_framework": "IDV-DELEGATED",
        "assurance_level": "VERIFIED",
        "time": "2024-10-07T10:00:00Z"
      },
      "claims": {
        "given_name": {
          "fuzzy": "Dan"
        }
        "family_name": "Jones"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Okta completes the policy evaluation

After the `id_token` is returned in the response from the `POST /token` request, Okta completes the policy evaluation.

Okta inspects `id_token` object. The policy evaluation is successful if the `trust_framework` and `assurance_level` values match the values that were passed in the `POST /oauth2/par` [request](#post-oauth2-par-request-to-idv-vendor), `IDV-DELEGATED` and `VERIFIED`.

If either of the `trust_framework` or `assurance_level` attributes aren't included in the `id_token` [response](#idv-vendor-id-token-response-example) or if they have `null` or unexpected values, then Okta marks the policy evaluation as unsuccessful.

#### Failed policy evaluation example

For example, a user completes an IDV flow but provides a name that doesn't match the `given_name` value. The `assurance_level` value is sent back as `FAILED` in the `id_token` response. And the `given_name` value is returned as `null`.

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store

{
  "id_token": {
    "verified_claims": [
      "verification": {
        "trust_framework": "IDV-DELEGATED",
        "assurance_level": "FAILED",
        "time": "2024-10-07T10:00:00Z"
      },
      "claims": {
        "given_name": null,
        "family_name": "Jones"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Identity verification events

There are two events related to identity verification: `user.identity_verification` and `user.identity_verification.start`. Okta admins can view these events in the System Log. See [Event Types](/docs/reference/api/event-type).

* `user.identity_verification.start`: This event is triggered when an Okta account management policy prompts a user to verify their identity with an IDV vendor.
* `user.identity_verification`: This event is triggered after Okta completes the evaluation of an Okta account management policy.

For the `user.identity_verification` event, there are two possible results for the event: `ALLOW` (user is successfully verified) or `DENY` (user isn't verified).

The `ALLOW` result provides a `CLAIMS_VERIFIED` reason that indicates the IDV vendor successfully verified the user.

There are multiple possible reasons for the `DENY` result:

* `PARSING_ERROR`: Indicates that Okta wasn't able to parse the response from the IDV vendor because of invalid or malformed data.
* `MISSING`: Indicates that a required parameter or value wasn't present in the request or response.
* `RESPONSE_PROCESSING_ERROR`: Indicates that Okta encountered an error while processing the response from the IDV vendor.
* `ERROR_RESPONSE`: Indicates that the IDV vendor returned an explicit error response to Okta.
* `EMPTY_USER_ID`: Indicates that no user ID was provided in the request to the IDV vendor.
* `MISSING_CODE_CHALLENGE`: Indicates that the code challenge required for PKCE was missing from the request.
* `MISSING_APP_INSTANCE`: Indicates that the application instance required for the IDV flow wasn't found or wasn't provided.
* `MISSING_AUTH_STATE_TOKEN`: Indicates that the authentication state token required for the flow was missing or invalid.
* `CLAIMS_NOT_VERIFIED`: Indicates that the IDV vendor has assessed that not all `claims` attributes were verified.
* `CLAIM_GIVEN_NAME_NOT_VERIFIED`: Indicates that the `given_name` value wasn't verified.
* `CLAIM_FAMILY_NAME_NOT_VERIFIED`: Indicates that the `family_name` value wasn't verified.

## Supported OIDC claims

Okta supports the following OIDC claims. IDV vendors can choose among any of these claims and use them in their IDV flow.

To use the claims that are Early Access, enable the **More Universal Directory attributes available for identity verification mapping** feature in your Okta org.

> **Note:** IDV vendors must always include the `given_name` and `family_name` claims.

| Supported claim | Description | DataType |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| given_name      | The user's first name. | String |
| family_name     | The user's last name or surname. | String |
| middle_name <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />    | The user's middle name. | String |
| email <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />          | The user's email address. | String |
| birthdate <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />      | The user's date of birth. Format the date of birth in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). | datetime |
| phone_number <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />   | The user's phone number. Format the phone number in the E.164 format | String |
| street_address <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> | The user's street address. This claim can include new lines. | String |
| locality <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />       | The user's city or locality. | String |
| region <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />         | The user's state, province, prefecture, or region. | String |
| postal_code <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />    | The user's postal or ZIP code. | String |
| country <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />        | The user's country. Format this value with the country name. | String |

### Map Okta user profile attributes to OIDC claims

<ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

Okta admins can map any of these supported claims to user profile attributes. See [Map profile attributes from Okta to the IDV vendor IdP](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=id-verification).

Admins can set user profile attributes as **required** when they map them to to the corresponding IDV vendor attribute. The `given_name` and `family_name` claims are **required** by default. When a PAR request is sent from Okta, and a **required** claim doesn't have a value in the user's profile, then the [initial PAR request](#post-oauth2-par-request-to-idv-vendor) fails.

However, if a claim is mapped but not set as **required**, and it doesn't have a value in the user's profile, then the claim is excluded from the initial PAR request. The PAR request isn't failed.

### Use the System Log to track identity verification events

Along with the IDV events (`user.identity_verification.start` and `user.identity_verification`), there are two properties that are attached to those events. The properties are also attached to the `policy.evaluate_sign_on` event when an Okta account management policy is involved.

* `IdvReferenceId`: This property provides a reference ID that's attached to all the relevant events of an IDV process.
* `IdvFlowId`: This property displays the ID of the IDV flow. Admins can use this property to more easily track information related to a specific IDV flow.
