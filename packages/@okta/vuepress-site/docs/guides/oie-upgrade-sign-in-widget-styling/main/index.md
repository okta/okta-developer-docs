title: Updates to the Sign-In Widget styling
---

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

After you upgrade your Sign-In Widget for Okta Identity Engine, you can modify the look of the initial sign-in page. See [Style the self-hosted Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-self-hosted/) for examples and information on how to [modify the initial sign-in page](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-self-hosted/#initial-sign-in-page) and how to make your own customizations to the Widget such as [increasing the Widget’s width](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-self-hosted/#widget-positioning-width) and [adding  a background color](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-self-hosted/#background).

> **Note:** If you make Sign-In Widget style customizations that are beyond Okta’s supported styles as documented in [Style the self-hosted Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/style-the-widget/style-self-hosted/), be aware that a Widget version update could potentially change your customizations. You should consider the risk before you migrate the customizations.
