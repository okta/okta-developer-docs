## Modify the style of your sign-in page

After you upgrade your widget to Identity Engine, modify the look of the initial sign-in page. See [Style the self-hosted Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#style-the-self-hosted-sign-in-widget) for examples of how to make changes:

* [Modify the initial sign-in page](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#initial-sign-in-page).
* [Increase the Sign-In Widget width](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#widget-positioning-width).
* [Add a background color](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#background).

> **Note:** Your style customizations beyond the supported styles in [Style the self-hosted Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#style-the-self-hosted-sign-in-widget) may change. A widget version update could alter your customizations. Consider the risks before you migrate your customizations.
