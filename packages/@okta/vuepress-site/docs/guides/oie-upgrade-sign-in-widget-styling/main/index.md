## Modify the style of your sign-in page

After you upgrade your Sign-In Widget to Okta Identity Engine, you can modify the look of the initial sign-in page. See [Style the self-hosted Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#style-the-self-hosted-sign-in-widget) for examples and information on how to [modify the initial sign-in page](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#initial-sign-in-page) and how to make your own customizations to the Widget such as [increasing the Widget's width](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#widget-positioning-width) and [adding a background color](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#background).

> **Note:** If you make Sign-In Widget style customizations that are beyond Okta's supported styles as documented in [Style the self-hosted Sign-In Widget](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/#style-the-self-hosted-sign-in-widget), be aware that a Widget version update could potentially change your customizations. You should consider the risk before you migrate the customizations.
