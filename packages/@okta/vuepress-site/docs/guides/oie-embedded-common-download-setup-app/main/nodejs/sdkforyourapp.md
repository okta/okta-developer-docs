After you run the sample app and explore the available use cases, you can begin to integrate the SDK and/or the Widget into your own app. To get started, follow these steps:

#### 1: Install the SDK into your project application

Download and install the SDK into your Express application. See [Getting Started](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#getting-started) in the Okta Auth JS repository.

#### 2: Install the @okta/okta-auth-js node dependency

Before using the SDK in your own app, you need to add the Okta Auth JS node dependency.

```console
npm install --save @okta/okta-auth-js
```

See [Using the npm module](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#using-the-npm-module) for more information.

#### Step 3: Review the Identity Engine SDK methods

Review the Identity Engine SDK methods for use with your application. See [Usage](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/blob/master/docs/idx.md#usage) for further information.
