After you satisfy the software requirements, clone the [okta-idx-dotnet](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-dotnet)
repository to your local directory. You run the sample app later after you [set the configuration values](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/-/main/#set-the-configuration-values).

The source code from the sample app and SDK is located here: `.../okta-idx-dotnet/src`. Under the `src` folder, the project structure consists of the following:

* `okta-idx-dotnet/src` &mdash; SDK source, unit tests, and integration tests
* `okta-idx-dotnet/samples` &mdash; sample directory
* `okta-idx-dotnet/samples/samples-aspnet/embedded-auth-with-sdk` &mdash; embedded SDK sample
* `okta-idx-dotnet/samples/samples-aspnet/embedded-sign-in-widget` &mdash; embedded Sign-In Widget sample
