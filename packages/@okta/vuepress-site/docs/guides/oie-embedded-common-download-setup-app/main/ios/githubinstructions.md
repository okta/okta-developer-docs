After you satisfy the software requirements, clone the [okta-idx-swift](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-swift) repository to your local directory. Run the sample app after you [set the configuration values](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/-/main/#set-the-configuration-values).

The `okta-idx-swift` repository includes the following directories:

* `/okta-idx-swift/Samples/EmbeddedAuthWithSDKs/EmbeddedAuth` &mdash; sample app directory
* `/okta-idx-swift/Sources/OktaIdx` &mdash; SDK Source
* `/okta-idx-swift/okta-idx.xcworkspace` &mdash; workspace file that contains the SDK and sample app projects
