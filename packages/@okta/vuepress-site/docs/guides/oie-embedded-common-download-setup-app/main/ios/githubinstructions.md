After you satisfy the software requirements, clone the [okta-idx-swift](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-swift) repository to your local directory. You run the sample app later after you [set the configuration values](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/-/main/#set-the-configuration-values).
