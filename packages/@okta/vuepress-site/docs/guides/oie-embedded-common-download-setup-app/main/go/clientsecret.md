#### Client secret

For the sample app, use the **Client secret** for the application that you created in [Create a new application](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/go/main/#create-a-new-application). To find this value, go to **Applications** > **Applications** in the Admin Console. Select your app, and then on the **General** tab, copy the **Client secret**.
