There are two main repositories for the embedded SDK and sample applications.
They are:


* [okta-idx-golang](https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-golang): The Okta
  embedded SDK which enables Golang projects to use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 +
  Open ID Connect provider. The SDK communicates with the Okta Identity
  Engine to authenticate and register users.

* [samples-golang](https://github.com/okta/samples-golang): Contains
  sample applications that demonstrate the various use cases supported
  by the embedded SDK.

    * **`samples-golang/identity-engine/embedded-auth-with-sdk`**
      Sample application that uses the embedded Sign-in Widget to authenticate
      the user.

    * **`samples-golang/identity-engine/embedded-sign-in-widget`**
      Sample application that uses the embedded SDK to authenticate the
      user.
