### Client secret

For the sample app, use the **Client secret** for the app integration that you created in [Create new application](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/java/main/#create-a-new-application). To find this value:
1. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** in the Admin Console.
1. Select your app, and then from the **General** tab, copy the **Client secret** value. Save this value for configuring your app when it starts.
