If you are setting up the embedded authentiation sample app, use `http://localhost:8080` as the redirect URI. Otherwise, use a redirect URI that is appropriate for your app.

> **Note:** The default redirect URI, `http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback` is listed when you create a new app integration in the Admin Console. Do not remove this redirect URI.
