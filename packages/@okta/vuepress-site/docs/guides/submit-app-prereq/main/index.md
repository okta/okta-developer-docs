This guide provides you with a list of the requirements needed before submitting your integration for publication in the [Okta Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/).

---

**Learning outcome**

Understand the requirements necessary to submit your integration using the [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com).

**What you need**

A built and tested OIN integration that's ready for Okta verification

---

## Overview

Before using the [OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com)&nbsp;to submit your OIN integration, you need to prepare for the artifacts requested during the submission process. Review the following submission artifact guidelines:

* [Logo](#logo-guidelines)
* [App description](#app-description-guidelines)
* [Use case](#use-case-guidelines)
* [Customer support contact](#customer-support-contact-guidelines)
* [Test account](#test-account-guidelines)
* [Customer configuration document](#customer-configuration-document-guidelines)

Before you submit your integration, ensure that your integration doesn't use Okta features that aren't supported in the OIN. See [OIN limitations](#oin-limitations).

## Logo guidelines

The app logo that you submit to the OIN Manager in the **General Settings** > **App icon** field must conform to the following:

* Submit a logo file that's less than one MB.
* Submit a logo image with one of the following dimensions:
  * 244 x 244 pixels for circular logos
  * 200 x 200 pixels for square logos
  * 244 x 156 pixels for tall logos
  * 156 x 244 pixels for wide logos
* Don't submit a logo with the trademark (:tm:) symbol.
* Submit an icon rather than a wordmark (a graphic that includes the company or product name).
   > **Note:** The OIN catalog already lists the product name in plain text. Logos with text can appear redundant.
* Submit a logo image that's in PNG format with a transparent background:
    * GIF and JPEG/JPG formats are also acceptable
    * A colored background is acceptable if it's a part of the logo color scheme
* Submit a logo image with sharp corners (no rounded corners).

### Logo tips

* If your logo isn't in one of the acceptable formats, ask your design team to convert your existing logo to the preferred PNG format.

* If your image isn't in one of the allowed dimensions, ask your design team to scale your logo appropriately. The OIN Manager doesn't allow you to submit any other dimensions.

* A square logo is preferred. If your logo isn't square, consider using your website favicon. Alternatively, you can use the first letter of your app wordmark and convert it to a square image.

## App description guidelines

From the OIN Manager, you can specify the app description in the **General Settings** > **App description** field. Descriptions must be less than 1024 characters and should describe the value that you provide to customers by partnering with Okta.

You can find the app description in the OIN catalog under the **Integration detail** > **Overview** section of your published integration.

##### Single Sign-On (SSO) app description example

Acme is a CMR platform that helps modern businesses thrive. A platform that connects different departments, from accounting to sales to customer service, in a centralized manner. Okta's Acme integration allows customers to sign in to the Acme platform using Okta as a Single Sign-On provider.

##### SSO and SCIM app description example

Acme is a CMR platform that helps modern businesses thrive. A platform that connects different departments, from accounting to sales to customer service, in a centralized manner. Okta’s Acme integration allows users to authenticate securely through Single Sign-On with SAML along with provisioning capabilities.

## Use case guidelines

The OIN catalog organizes integrations into use cases. From the OIN Manager, you can specify the use case categories that your integration supports in the **General Settings** > **App use case** field. You can select up to five use cases. Use the following description list to determine the appropriate use case category for your integration:

| Use case | Integration capability |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| [Single Sign-On](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=single-sign-on) (most common) | Enables users to access your application from any device with a single entry of their Okta user credentials. This use case is appropriate for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC) integrations. |
| [Automation](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=automation)  | Automates business processes and Okta administration tasks. Most integrations in this use case are API service integrations that access Okta’s APIs using OAuth 2.0.  |
| [Centralized Logging](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=centralized-logging) | Aggregates Okta logs into a central location, like a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool, for optimized searching and alerting capabilities. API service integrations that poll the Okta API for System Logs using OAuth 2.0 support this use case. |
| [Directory and HR Sync](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=directory-and-hr-sync) | Provides synchronization capabilities for external-sourced user profiles with the Okta Universal Directory. This use case is most common for human resources (HR) solutions using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) or [Okta Workflows](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=wf). |
| [Lifecycle Management](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=lifecycle-management) | Enables organizations to securely manage their entire identity lifecycle: from on-boarding to off-boarding, and ensuring that the company meets compliance requirements as user roles evolve and access levels change. This use case is most common with either SCIM or Workflows connector integrations. |
| [Identity Proofing](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=identity-proofing) | Enables user self-verification to improve identity assurance and approve access for authorized individuals using document-based and/or knowledge-based proofs |
| [Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=identity-governance-and-administration-iga) | Simplifies and manages an organization's identity and access lifecycles across multiple systems |
| [Zero Trust](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=zero-trust) | Enables secure access for users regardless of their location, device, or network |
| [Bot or Fraud Detection](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=bot-or-fraud-detection) | Provides protection from inauthentic, forged, or otherwise fraudulent attempts to register, sign in, recover, or perform identity-related transactions. Most integrations in this use case are API service integrations that send risk signals to Okta using OAuth 2.0. |
| [Multifactor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=multi-factor-authentication-mfa) | Provides an extra layer of security with multifactor authentication for an organization's cloud, mobile, and web apps |
| [Risk Signal Sharing](https://www.okta.com/integrations/?category=risk-signal-sharing)| Provides enriched context on clients, apps, users, and other first-party subjects to augment and inform Okta adaptive authentication and authorization decisions |

## Customer support contact guidelines

Specify support contacts for your integration in the **General Settings** > **Customer Support** fields from the OIN Manager. There are two types of contacts that you must provide:

* **Support contacts**: These are public support contacts that are visible from your integration detail page in the OIN catalog. These contacts are for customers who need assistance with your integration. You can provide more than one of the following contact options:
    * **URL**: A link to an FAQ or a troubleshooting guide (see an [OIN URL support contact example](https://www.okta.com/integrations/onfido/))
    * **Email**: An email support contact, such as `support@your-app.com` (see an [OIN email support contact example](https://www.okta.com/integrations/careervillage/))
    * **Phone Number**: A public phone number that customers can call for support

* **Escalation support contact**: This is a private support contact used by Okta to contact your organization. It isn't shared with customers. In an emergency, Okta may need to reach your company's escalation support team, so this email or phone number needs to be monitored. Don’t use a general support contact that queues regular customer inquiries.

## Test account guidelines

Create a test account for your app so that the OIN team can use it to test and verify your integration. Specify test account details and credentials in the **General Settings** > **Test Account** fields in the OIN Manager.

The test account allows the OIN team to verify that your integration flow works as expected for your use case. The test account is typically an admin user in your app with extra privileges depending on your use case:

* For a lifecycle management integration, ensure that your admin test account has HR admin privileges to onboard, change roles, or offboard employees on your app.
* For an SSO or SCIM integration, ensure that your admin test account has privileges to configure SSO and SCIM. The OIN team needs to verify whether users and/or groups were created by SCIM provisioning or by SAML/OIDC (JiT) in your application.
* For an API service integration, ensure that your admin test account has privileges to configure an API integration and trigger API requests in your application.

> **Note:** The OIN team recommends `isvtest@okta.com` as the test account username, however, you can provide an alternative username with a different domain.

## Customer configuration document guidelines

A configuration guide helps your customers understand how to configure your Okta integration to work with your cloud application.

Provide a separate configuration guide as part of the OIN submission process for each type of integration:

* Format the guide so that it's accessible through a URL link (such as a webpage, a Google doc, or a PDF).
* During the OIN verification process, ensure that the link to your configuration guide is accessible to the OIN team. The OIN team checks your document for general adherence to the configuration instructions.
* After your integration is in the OIN catalog, ensure that your guide link is public or customer-accessible.

Your guide link is available to customer administrators through the Okta Admin Console when they add your integration to their Okta org. For example, when admins add your SAML integration in the Admin Console, they have access to your guide through the **View SAML setup instructions** link.

> **Note**: Submit a separate guide for each type of integration if your integration supports more than one type. For example, if your integration supports both SSO and SCIM, you need to submit a guide for SSO and a separate guide for SCIM.

### Configuration guide content

The following are section suggestions for your configuration guide:

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Supported features](#supported-features)
* [Configuration steps](#configuration-steps)
* [SP-initiated SSO](#sp-initiated-sso)
* [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)

> **Note:** Each section contains examples for OIDC, SAML, or SCIM content. You can use the examples as an initial template. Copy and paste the example markdown text into your customer configuration document and customize the content for your integration.

#### Prerequisites

In this section, specify any prerequisites required before your customer configures your integration in Okta. Examples may include enabling specific Okta features, enabling API access to your SCIM server, or adding a particular version of an integration in Okta.

##### SAML prerequisite example

```markdown
## Prerequisites

When using SAML as the SSO mode with provisioning, you need to enable a specific account plan on the application side for silent activation.
```

#### Supported features

In this section of your guide, list the features that your application supports and include any restrictions or limitations.

> **Note:** You can also briefly describe what each feature does.

##### OIDC supported feature example

```markdown
## Supported features

* SP-initiated SSO (Single Sign-On)
* IdP-initiated SSO (through [Third-party Initiated Login](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ThirdPartyInitiatedLogin))
* Just-In-Time provisioning
* SP-initiated SLO (Single Logout)

For more information on the listed features, visit the [Okta Glossary](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext_glossary).
```

##### SAML supported feature example

```markdown
## Supported features

* IdP-initiated SSO
* SP-initiated SSO
* Just-In-Time provisioning
* SP-initiated SLO
* Force authentication

For more information on the listed features, visit the [Okta Glossary](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext_glossary).
```

##### SCIM supported feature example

```markdown
## Supported features

* Create users
* Update user attributes
* Deactivate users
* Import users
* Import groups
* Sync password
* Profile sourcing
* Group push

Okta can't update user attributes for Admin users. This is an API limitation.

For more information on the listed features, visit the [Okta Glossary](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext_glossary).
```

#### Configuration steps

This section helps you define how your customers get set up with your integration. Detail all settings and include any images that can assist the user. Include any best practices for your procedure, such as SCIM guidance on mappings for attributes, especially required attributes that don't have a default mapping.

> **Note:** If your Service Provider is configured as a "Big Bang", you need to provide a warning note to your customer. See [SAML configuration warning example](#saml-configuration-warning-example).

##### SAML configuration warning example

If you only allow sign-in through Okta (Big Bang configuration), ensure that you provide a warning note before the configuration steps. For example:

```markdown
### Read this before you enable SAML

Enabling SAML affects all users who use this application.
Users won't be able to sign in through their regular sign-in page.
They are able to access the app through the Okta service.

### Backup URL

{appName} doesn't provide a backup sign-in URL where users can sign in using their regular username and password.
If necessary, contact {appName} Support (support@{appName}.com) to turn off SAML.
```

##### SAML configuration steps example

The following is an example of a simple SAML customer procedure:

```markdown
## Configuration steps

1. Copy the Metadata URL from the Okta Admin Console, SAML 2.0 Sign on methods section.
2. Contact the {appName} support team (for example, support@{appName}.com) and request that they enable SAML 2.0 for your account. Include the "Metadata URL" value from the previous step.
   The {appName} support team processes your request and provides you with an SSO ID and an encryption certificate.
3. In your Okta Admin Console, select the Sign on tab for the {appName} SAML app, then click "Edit" and follow the steps below:
   * "Encryption Certificate": Upload the certificate provided by {appName} support in the previous step.
   * Scroll down to Advanced Sign-on Settings and enter your "SSO ID".
   * Application username format: Select "email".
   * Click "Save".
4. Your SAML configuration for {appName} is complete. You can start assigning people to the application.
```

> **Note:** The **Sign On** tab for your app integration may have different fields from the previous example. Adjust your configuration guide as required from the example template.

For a complete customer configuration guide example that requires support to configure SAML, see [How to Configure SAML 2.0 Template with company support](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-Template-with-company-support.html).

##### SAML admin configuration steps example

For some integrations, the customer admin needs to configure SAML settings in your app. The following is an example of an admin procedure to configure SAML settings:

```markdown
## Configuration steps

1. Copy the Metadata URL from the SAML 2.0 Metadata details section in the Admin Console and save this value for the next few steps.
2. Sign in to {appName}.
3. Navigate to Admin >  Settings > SAML SSO.
4. Specify the following:
   * ENABLE SAML SSO: Select "Yes".
   * IDP Provider: Select "Okta".
   * Metadata URL: Copy and paste the metadata URL value from step one.
4. Click "Save Changes".

The SAML setting is complete in {appName}.
```

> **Note:** Your app integration may require specific SAML settings than the SAML **Metadata URL** (such as **Sign on URL**, **Sign out URL**, **Issuer**, or **Signing Certificate** settings).
> You can find these SAML settings at **Applications** > **Applications** > your SAML app > **Sign-On Options** tab > **Sign on methods** > **SAML 2.0** > **Metadata details** in the Admin Console. See [Configure Single Sign-On options](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext_Apps_Overview_of_Managing_Apps_and_SSO). Adjust your configuration guide as required from the example template.

For a complete customer admin configuration guide example, see [How to Configure SAML 2.0 Template for admins](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-Template-self.html).

##### SAML configuration steps note example

```markdown
## Note

* Ensure that you entered the correct value in the "Subdomain" field under the General tab. The wrong subdomain value prevents you from authenticating through SAML to {appName}.

* Since only SP-initiated flow is supported, Okta recommends hiding the application icon for users.

* The following SAML attributes are supported:

   | Name      | Value          |
   | --------- | -------------- |
   | email     | user.email     |
   | firstName | user.firstName |
   | lastName  | user.lastName  |
```

##### SCIM configuration steps note example

```markdown
## Note

The External ID is a required attribute, but it doesn't have a default mapping.
This is because some customers prefer to set it to `EmployeeNumber`, and others like to set it to `emailAddress`.
Assign the mapping to the correct value for your organization.
```

#### SP-initiated SSO

> **Note**: This section applies only to SAML or OIDC integrations that support app-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO), also known as service provider (SP) initiated SSO.

Provide instructions for your users to sign in with Okta from your app. The user sign-in flow starts from your app's sign-in page. The user enters their credentials and your app sends the authorization request to Okta (the Identity Provider) to authenticate the user.

##### SP-initiated SSO instructions example

```markdown
## SP-initiated SSO

The sign-in process is initiated from {yourAppPortal}.

1. From your browser, navigate to the {appName} sign-in page.
2. Enter your Okta credentials (your email and password) and click "Sign in with Okta".
If your credentials are valid, you are redirected to the {appName} dashboard.
```

#### Troubleshoot

Include this section if there are known issues that apply to the entire configuration. You can include best practices with the step-by-step procedure instructions. You can also include information on how to contact your organization if the customer has any support queries.

## OIN limitations

You can't publish integrations with the following Okta features in the OIN catalog:

* **SWA apps:** Okta no longer publishes new Secure Web Authentication (SWA) integrations to the OIN catalog. The OIN team maintains existing SWA integrations.

* **Custom authorization server:** An OIDC or API service integration can't use a [custom authorization server](/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#custom-authorization-server), including the default server. You can only use the [Org authorization server](/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#org-authorization-server).

* **Refresh token:**  Refresh tokens aren't supported for integrations published in the OIN.

* **Unsupported scopes:** <br>
   * The `offline_access` scope isn't available because refresh tokens aren't supported for integrations published in the OIN.
   * Custom scopes, such as the `groups` scope, aren't supported for integrations published in the OIN.
   * ISVs shouldn't rely on the `email_verified` scope-dependent claim returned by an OIDC integration to evaluate whether a user has verified ownership of the email address associated with their profile.

* **SAML encryption:** SAML integrations must use SHA256 encryption for security. If you're using SHA-1 for encryption, see our guide on how to [Upgrade SAML Apps to SHA256](/docs/guides/updating-saml-cert/).
