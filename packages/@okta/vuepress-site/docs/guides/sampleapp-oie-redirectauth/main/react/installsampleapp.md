1. Install the sample app wherever you want using: `git clone https://github.com/okta/samples-js-react.git`

2. From the command line, enter the `okta-hosted-login` directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

3. Create a `testenv` file in the `samples-js-react` directory and add the information that you copied in previous steps:

    ```ini
      ISSUER=https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
      CLIENT_ID=${ClientID}
    ```
