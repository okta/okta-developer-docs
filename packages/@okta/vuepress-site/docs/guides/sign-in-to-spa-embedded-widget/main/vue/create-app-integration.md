Before you integrate Okta authentication to your Vue.js app, register your app in your Okta org. This provides you with the OpenID Connect client ID for authentication requests from your app. Register your app by creating an Okta app integration through the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/), the [Okta Apps API](/docs/reference/api/apps/), or through the [Admin Console](/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/#admin-console) with the following steps.

1. To create an Okta app integration that represents your Vue.js app, sign in to [your Admin Console](https://login.okta.com).
2. From the side navigation, select **Applications** > **Applications**, and then click **Create App Integration**.
3. In the dialog that appears, select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as the **Sign-in method**, **Single-Page Application** as the **Application type**, and then click **Next**.
4. Fill in the following new app integration settings, and then click **Save**:

    | Setting                | Value/Description                                    |
    | -------------------    | ---------------------------------------------------  |
    | App integration name   | Specify a unique name for your app.                  |
    | Grant types            | Select **Authorization Code**, **Interaction Code**, and  **Refresh Token**. |
    | Sign-in redirect URIs  | Specify your app URI for the callback redirect from Okta. For example: `http://localhost:8080/login/callback` |
    | Sign-out redirect URIs | Specify your app sign-out redirect URI. For example: `http://localhost:8080` |
    | Trusted Origins > Base URIs | Specify your app base URI for CORS. For example: `http://localhost:8080`|
    | Assignments   | Assign users for your app.                                |

    > **Note:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is automatically enabled for the Trusted Origins base URI that you specified in the Admin Console. If you're using the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/manual/apps/create/) to create your SPA Okta app integration, CORS is also automatically enabled for your base URI. You can verify that both **CORS** and **redirect** are enabled for your app by reviewing the **Security** > **API** > **Trusted Origins** page in the Admin Console.

### Okta org app integration configuration settings

You need two pieces of information from your org and app integration for your Vue.js app:

* **Client ID**: From the **General** tab of your app integration, save the generated **Client ID** value.
* **Issuer**: From the **General** tab of your app integration, save the **Okta domain** value. Use your Okta domain value for the [issuer](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/nodejs/main/#issuer) setting that represents the authorization server. Use `https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default` as the issuer for your app if you're using the Okta Developer Edition org. See [Issuer configuration](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/nodejs/main/#issuer) if you want to use another Okta custom authorization server.
