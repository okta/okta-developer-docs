After you complete a basic-sign flow for the Vue.js app with the Sign-In Widget, you can extend your app's sign-in experience by adding features such as multifactor or social IdP authentication. There is almost no code required in your app to add these features because the Sign-In Widget provides the mechanism to handle these use cases. These features are enabled by configuring Okta authenticators and authentication policies for your app. See:

* [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case)
* [Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case)

> **Note**: Okta org configuration is supported by the Admin Console and by the Okta API.
