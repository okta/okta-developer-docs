After you complete a basic-sign flow for the Vue.js app with the Sign-In Widget, you can extend your app's sign-in experience. You can add features such as multifactor or social IdP authentication. Thereâ€™s almost no code required in your app to add these features because the Sign-In Widget provides the mechanism to handle these use cases.

These features are enabled by configuring Okta authenticators and authentication policies for your app:

* [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/set-up-org/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case)
* [Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case)

> **Note**: The Admin Console and the Okta API support Okta org configuration.
