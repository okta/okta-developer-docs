After you complete a basic-sign flow for the Vue.js app with the Sign-In Widget, you can extend your app's sign-in experience by adding features such as multifactor or social IdP authentication. There is almost no code required in your app to add these features because the Sign-In Widget provides the mechanism to handle these use cases. These features are enabled by configuring your Okta org and the sign-on policies for your app.

* See [Set up your Okta org for a multifactor use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-multifactor-use-case).
* See [Set up your Okta org for a social IdP use case](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/nodejs/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-social-idp-use-case).
* See [Sign in with Facebook using the Widget](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-sign-in-soc-idp/) for an example of a web application that uses the Sign-In Widget with social IdP authentication.

> **Note**: Okta org configuration is supported by the Admin Console and by the Okta API.
