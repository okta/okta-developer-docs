The embedded Okta Sign-In Widget provides user authentication, and an opportunity to customize the sign-in experience for your Angular app.

This guide explains how to build a sample app with the embedded Sign-In Widget that's included in the [okta/samples-js-angular](https://github.com/okta/samples-js-angular) repository. It also reviews code snippets that you can use for your Angular app's authentication needs. The sample app uses the embedded widget to sign in to a simple web page that provides details on the user signed in.

>**Note:** This sample app references `Angular CLI` v14.2.0, `okta-sign-in-widget` v7.14.0, and `okta-auth-js` v7.0.2. It was most recently tested against `Angular CLI` v18.2.7 and `Node` v20.11.1
