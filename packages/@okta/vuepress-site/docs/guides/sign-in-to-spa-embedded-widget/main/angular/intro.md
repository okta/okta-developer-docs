The embedded Okta Sign-In Widget provides user authentication, as well as an opportunity to customize the sign-in experience for your Angular application.

This guide explains how to build a sample application with the embedded Sign-In Widget included in the [okta/samples-js-angular](https://github.com/okta/samples-js-angular) repository, and reviews code snippets that you can use for your Angular application's authentication  needs. The sample application uses the embedded Widget to sign in to a simple web page that provides details on the user signed in.

>**Note:** This sample application uses `Angular CLI` v11.2.17, `Node` v14.15.5, and `okta-auth-js` v5.9.1.
