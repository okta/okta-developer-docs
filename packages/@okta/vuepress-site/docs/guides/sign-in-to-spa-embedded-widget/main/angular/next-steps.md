You have now successfully authenticated with Okta. With a user's `id_token`, you have basic claims for the user's identity. You can extend the set of claims by modifying the `scopes` to retrieve custom information about the user. This includes `locale`, `address`, `groups`, and [more](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/).
