This section discusses the alternate flows that can occur within your app based on how your factors and policies are configured.

## Confirmation email sent during new user registration with only password factor required

Even when only the password factor is required for an Okta application, an email can still be sent.

### Use cases with this alternate flow

[Self-service registration (email and optional phone factor)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-self-reg/)

### Set up

In this scenario, the org is set up in the following manner:

1. The org is initially configured following the steps described in:
[Set up your Okta org (for password factor only use cases)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-password-factor-only-use-cases)
and [Set up your Okta org (for multifactor use cases)](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-multi-factor-use-cases).
2. The application's sign-on policy is updated for only the password factor. In
   the Admin Console, the **AND User must authenticate with** field is set to **Password**.

3. The **Email verification** field in the profile enrollment's Default Policy
   is set to **Required before access is granted**. Profile enrollment configuration can
   be found by navigating to **Security** > **Profile Enrollment**.

4. The **Initiate login URI** field is set to the sign-in URI in the application settings. By setting this
   value, the email verification link for new user enrollment redirects the user
   to the URL provided in the **Initiate login URI** field.

### Flow behavior

During new user registration, there are no factors required other than
the password. However, email verification is set to **Required**
in the profile enrollment configuration. In this case, the user is sent an email using
the following email template: **Registration - Activation**.

The user clicks the link in the activation email and is redirected to the
sample app's home page.
