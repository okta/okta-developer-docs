You refreshed a token when checking for an existing session in [Check for a session at startup](#check-for-a-session-at-startup). In this case you may want to catch any errors that occur.

Update `refreshToken` in `ContentView.swift` with the following code:

```swift
func refreshToken() {
   if let credential = Credential.default {
      Task {
         busy = true
         do {
            try await credential.refreshIfNeeded()
         }
         catch {
            showError(title: "Unable to Refresh Token", error: error)
         }
         busy = false
      }
   } else {
      showError(title: "Unable to Refresh Token", message: "An unknown issue prevented refreshing the token. Please try again.")
   }
}
```

Most of the code is for handling errors or controlling the state of the busy view.

Tokens are usually refreshed on a regular basis. Each refresh requires network activity, which is one of the operations that requires higher battery use. In your production app, the best practice is to refresh a token only when it's required to authenticate a server call. Some other considerations for refreshing a token include:

- Checking if network connectivity is disabled, such as Airplane mode.
- Checking if the device is using Data rather than WiFi.
- Handling failed refresh attempts, especially when the server can't be reached.

The `Token` class contains information such as expiry date. The following function displays the access token, its issue and expiry dates, and any associated refresh token in the info area:

```swift
func showTokenInfo() {
   infoText = ""
   var tokenString = "Unable to show token"
   if let token = Credential.default?.token {
      let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
      dateFormatter.timeStyle = .medium
      dateFormatter.dateStyle = .medium

      tokenString = ""
      if let issued = token.issuedAt {
         tokenString += "Issue Date: \(dateFormatter.string(from: issued))\n"
      }
      if let expiry = token.expiresAt {
         tokenString += "Expiry Date: \(dateFormatter.string(from: expiry))\n"
      }
      if token.isExpired {
         tokenString += "---EXPIRED---\n"
      }
      tokenString += "\nAccess Token\n\n\(token.accessToken)\n\n"
      if let refreshToken = token.refreshToken {
         tokenString += "\nRefresh Token\n\n\(refreshToken)"
      }
   }
   infoText = tokenString
}
```
