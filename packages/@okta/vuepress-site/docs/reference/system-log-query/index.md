# System Log query

This guide is intended as a companion guide for use with the Okta [System Log API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/). It provides extra details and examples on how to query the System Log effectively.

The System Log API provides near real-time, read-only access to your org's System Log and is the programmatic counterpart of the [System Log UI](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext_Reports_SysLog).

The log records system events that are related to your org. These records provide detailed information on events, activities, and performance metrics critical to the operations between your Okta org, apps, and users. You can use the System Log to:

* diagnose errors or problems
* ensure security and compliance
* optimize performance
* investigate and troubleshoot incidents

For the full request and response schemas of the System Log API, see [System Log](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog).

#### Authentication and authorization

The System Log API uses standard protocols for authentication and authorization, including the proprietary Okta SSWS API tokens. However, Okta recommends using scoped OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens to authenticate with the System Log API and other management APIs. OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens provide fine-grain control over the bearer's actions on specific endpoints. See [Okta API authentication methods](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/).

## Event Types

Event Types categorize event instances by action and are recorded in the response to a [System Log API query](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog/operation/listLogEvents). Theyâ€™re the key to navigating the System Log through [Expression Filters](#expression-filter).

The following sections outline a representative sample of Event Types. See the [Event Types catalog](/docs/reference/api/event-types/#catalog) for a complete list.

### Application event

| Event                                          | Description                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| application.lifecycle.activate                 | An app is activated                              |
| application.lifecycle.create                   | An app is created                                |
| application.lifecycle.deactivate               | An app is deactivated                            |
| application.lifecycle.delete                   | An app is deleted                                |
| application.lifecycle.update                   | An app is updated                                |
| application.user_membership.add                | A user is assigned to an app.                    |
| application.user_membership.change_username    | The name of a user who is assigned to an app is changed |
| application.user_membership.remove             | A user is removed from an app                    |

### Group event

| Event                          | Description                      |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| group.user_membership.add      | A user is added to a group     |
| group.user_membership.remove   | A user is removed from a group |

### Policy events

| Event                         | Description                         |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| policy.lifecycle.activate     | A lifecycle policy is activated   |
| policy.lifecycle.create       | A lifecycle policy is created     |
| policy.lifecycle.deactivate   | A lifecycle policy is deactivated |
| policy.lifecycle.delete       | A lifecycle policy is deleted     |
| policy.lifecycle.update       | A lifecycle policy is updated     |
| policy.rule.activate          | A rule in a policy is activated   |
| policy.rule.add               | A rule is added to a policy       |
| policy.rule.deactivate        | A rule in a policy is deactivated |
| policy.rule.delete            | A rule is deleted from a policy   |
| policy.rule.update            | A rule in a policy is updated     |

#### Policy event details

* `policy.evaluate_sign_on` provides context on the values that are used and evaluated in the context of the Okta sign-on policy. For example, you can determine which network zones are matched for this event.
* For `policy.lifecycle` and `policy.rule` events, the corresponding policy is listed in the target object.

### Rate limit events

See [System Log events for rate limits](/docs/reference/rl-system-log-events/) for information on rate limit Event Types.

Rate limit violations are sent when a rate limit is exceeded.

### Security events

| Event                    | Description                                                                                   |
| :-------------------     | :----------------------------------                                                           |
| security.request.blocked | A request is blocked due to a blocklist rule (such as an IP network zone or location rule). |

### User events

| Event                       | Description                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| user.authentication.sso     | A user attempts a Single Sign-On (SSO) to an app managed in Okta |
| user.lifecycle.activate     | A user account is activated                             |
| user.lifecycle.create       | A user account is created                               |
| user.lifecycle.deactivate   | A user account is deactivated                           |
| user.lifecycle.suspend      | A user account is suspended                             |
| user.lifecycle.unsuspend    | A user account is moved from suspended status           |
| user.session.start          | Okta issues a session to a user who is authenticating    |

## Event correlation

When reviewing the System Log, it's often useful to correlate events to understand the thread of events that have occurred at a particular time.

The response object offers the following identifiers in this respect:

* `authenticationContext.externalSessionId`: Identifies events that occurred in the same user session
* `transaction.id`: Identifies events that have occurred together as part of an operation (for example, a request to the Okta servers)
* `authenticationContext.rootSessionId`: Identifies events from all sessions that share a common root session. Some actions that can be attributed to a user, such as those taken by an Okta system actor on behalf of a user, may have a different `externalSessionId` value. The `rootSessionId` field allows all of those to be identified and grouped together.

### Correlating events based on API token

It may be useful to identify multiple events that are the result of an action made using a specific API token. For example, when investigating a [rate limit warning](/docs/reference/rate-limits/), the events made by a specific token may be helpful in identifying the cause of the warning. The filter `filter=transaction.detail.requestApiTokenId eq "00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5"` returns all events that were the result of an action made using the token `00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5`, subject to other parameters of the query.

### Event correlation example

The following table shows 18 events produced from 13 transactions over six different sessions, all performed by one user.

**Note:** `authenticationContext.externalSessionId` is abbreviated to `sessionId` in this table.

| sessionId                   | transaction.id                | uuid                                   | Event Type                                     | displayMessage                        |

[[.table-word-break]]

As evidenced by the `null` `authenticationContext.externalSessionId` field in the last row, neither `transaction.id` nor `uuid` maintain a many-to-one relationship with `authenticationContext.externalSessionId`. In this particular case, the `null` `authenticationContext.externalSessionId` is a user sign-in failure. Thereâ€™s no session granted to the user's client because of the sign-in failure.

## List events

Use the [List all System Log Events](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog/operation/listLogEvents) endpoint to retrieve a list of events from your org. By default, this request returns a limit of 100 response objects.

##### Request types

All requests to the `/api/v1/logs` endpoint fall into one of these two categories:

* [Polling Requests](#polling-requests)
* [Bounded Requests](#bounded-requests)

###### Polling requests

Polling requests are for situations when you want to consume an ongoing stream of events from Okta.

Example use cases include:

* [Ingesting System Log data into an external SIEM system](#transfer-data-to-a-separate-system).
* Using System Log data for real-time monitoring.

For a request to be a polling request, it must meet the following request parameter criteria:

* `until` is unspecified.
* `sortOrder` is `ASCENDING`.

Polling requests to the `/api/v1/logs` API have the following semantics:

* They return every event that occurs in your org.
* The returned events are ordered by the internal persistence time, which reflects when an event is actually committed to the log, and not necessarily the timestamp when the event occurred. The persistence time may differ from the externally available published timestamp.
* They may return events out of order according to the `published` field.
* They have an infinite number of pages. That is, a [`next` `link` relation header](#next-link-response-header) is always present, even if there are no new events (the event list may be empty).

###### Bounded requests

Bounded requests are for situations when you know the definite time period of logs that you want to retrieve.

Example use cases include:

* [Debugging or troubleshooting system behavior](#debugging)
* Auditing events that happened at a particular time

For a request to be a bounded request, it must meet the following request parameter criteria:

* `since` is specified
* `until` is specified

Bounded requests to the `/api/v1/logs` API have the following semantics:

* The returned events are ordered and filtered by their associated `published` field (unlike [Polling Requests](#polling-requests)).
* The returned events are guaranteed to be in order according to the `published` field.
* They have a finite number of pages. That is, the last page doesn't contain a [`next` `link` relation header](#next-link-response-header).
* Not all events for the specified time range may be present. Some events may be delayed. Such delays are rare but possible.

##### Filter results

###### Expression filter

An expression filter is useful for performing structured queries where you can explicitly target constraints on the response object's attribute values.

The following example expressions are supported for events with the `filter` query parameter:

| Filter                                       | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `eventType eq ":eventType"`                  | Events that have a specific action [eventType](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog/operation/listLogEvents!c=200&path=eventType&t=response)                    |
| `target.id eq ":id"`                         | Events that are published with a specific [target](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog/operation/listLogEvents!c=200&path=target&t=response) ID                                     |
| `actor.id eq ":id"`                          | Events that are published with a specific [actor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog/operation/listLogEvents!c=200&path=actor&t=response) ID                                      |

> **Note:** SCIM filter expressions can't use the `published` attribute since it may conflict with the logic of the `since`, `after`, and `until` query parameters.
> In addition, a SCIM filter expression that uses the `co` (contains) operator with the `debugContext.debugData.url` or the `debugContext.debugData.requestUri` attribute isnâ€™t supported.
> A request with an invalid SCIM filter expression returns an HTTP 400 API response.

See [Filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) for more information on expressions.

The following are examples of filter expressions:

* Events that are published for a target user

```javascript
filter=target.id eq "00uxc78lMKUMVIHLTAXY"
```

* Events that are published for all actors except for a specific user

```javascript
filter=actor.id ne "00uxc78lMKUMVIHLTAXY"
```

* Failed sign-in events

```javascript
filter=eventType eq "user.session.start" and outcome.result eq "FAILURE"
```

* Events that are published for a target user and app

```javascript
filter=target.id eq "00uxc78lMKUMVIHLTAXY" and target.id eq "0oabe82gnXOFVCDUMVAK"
```

* App SSO events for a target user and app

```javascript
filter=eventType eq "user.authentication.sso" and target.id eq "00uxc78lMKUMVIHLTAXY" and target.id eq "0oabe82gnXOFVCDUMVAK"
```

* Events that are published for a given IP address

```javascript
filter=client.ipAddress eq "184.73.186.14"
```

* Events that start with `event_hook`

```javascript
filter=eventType sw "event_hook"
```

* Events that contain session

```javascript
filter=eventType co "session"
```

* Events that end with a token

```javascript
filter=eventType ew "token"
```

###### Keyword filter

You can use the query parameter `q` to perform keyword matching against a response object's attribute values. All supplied keywords must be matched exactly.

>**Note:** Keyword matching is case-insensitive.

The following are examples of common keyword filtering:

* Events that mention a specific city: `q=San Francisco`
* Events that mention a specific URL: `q=interestingURI.com`
* Events that mention a specific person: `q=firstName lastName`

> **Note:** When hyphens are present in an event instance's attribute value, theyâ€™re split and added to the list of matching candidates, in addition to the fully hyphenated value. Therefore, events that contain the text `XOxBw-2JIRnCFd0gG0GjHAAABjY` are matched with a `q` value of `XOxBw`, `2JIRnCFd0gG0GjHAAABjY`, or `XOxBw-2JIRnCFd0gG0GjHAAABjY`.

###### Date and time filter

You can filter the System Log response objects by the response object's [published](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog/operation/listLogEvents!c=200&path=published&t=response) attribute value with the following combination of parameters:

* `since`
* `until`
* `since` and `until`
* `after`

>**Note:** `since` and `after` are mutually exclusive and can't be specified simultaneously.

The `after` parameter is system generated for use in ["next" links](#next-link-response-header). Don't attempt to craft requests that use this value. Rely on the system-generated links instead.

##### System Log API response

The System Log API response contains a JSON array of [response](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/#tag/SystemLog/operation/listLogEvents!c=200&path=actor&t=response) objects.

###### Self link response header

The response always includes a `self` `link` header, which is a link to the current query that was executed.

The header has the following format:

```bash
link: <url>; rel="self"
```

For example:

```bash
link: <https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?q=&sortOrder=DESCENDING&limit=20&until=2017-09-17T23%3A59%3A59%2B00%3A00&since=2017-06-10T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00>; rel="self"
```

###### Next link response header

The response may include a `next` `link` header, which is a link to the next page of results, if thereâ€™s one.

>**Note:** While the `self` `link` always exists, the `next` `link` may not exist.

The header has the following format:

```bash
link: <url>; rel="next"
```

For example:

```bash
link: <https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?q=&sortOrder=DESCENDING&limit=20&until=2017-09-17T15%3A41%3A12.994Z&after=349996bd-5091-45dc-a39f-d357867a30d7&since=2017-06-10T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00>; rel="next"
```

#### Timeouts

Individual queries have a timeout of 30 seconds.

## Transfer data to a separate system

You can export your log events to a separate system for analysis or compliance. To obtain the entire dataset, query from the appropriate time in the past.

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?since=2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"
```

Then retrieve the next page of events through the [link response header](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#link-header) value with the `next` link relation. Continue this process until no events are returned.

>**Note:** Don't transfer data by manually paginating using `since` and `until`, as this may lead to skipped or duplicated events. Instead, always follow the `next` links.

For further information on exporting system log events to external platforms, see [Log streaming](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-log-streams) and the [Log Streaming API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LogStream/#tag/LogStream).

### Errors

The System Log API provides errors of the following types:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000001",
  "errorSummary": "Api validation failed: 'until': The date format in your query is not recognized. Please enter dates using ISO8601 string format. 'until': must be a valid date-time or empty.",
  "errorId": "dd4998a1-2267-499b-9e4d-ec821fcc5ca9",
  "errorCauses": [
    {
      "errorSummary": "until: The date format in your query is not recognized. Please enter dates using ISO8601 string format."
    },
    {
      "errorSummary": "until: must be a valid date-time or empty."
    }
  ]
}
```

An invalid SCIM filter returns the HTTP 400 error with a description of the issue with the SCIM filter, for example:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "Invalid filter 'display_message eqq \"Create okta user\"': Unrecognized attribute operator 'eqq' at position 16. Expected: eq,co,sw,pr,gt,ge,lt,le",
  "errorId": "eb83dfe1-6d76-458c-8c0c-f8df8fb7a24b"
}
```

An invalid field returns the HTTP 400 error with a message that indicates which field is invalid, for example:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "field is not valid: some_invalid_field",
  "errorId": "ec93dhe2-6d76-458c-8c0c-f8df8fb7a24b"
}
```

The following is another example, where the parameters are invalid:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "Invalid parameter: The since parameter is over 180 days prior to the current day.",
  "errorId": "55166534-b7d8-45a5-a4f6-3b38a5507046"
}
```

An invalid SCIM field and operator combination within a `filter` request parameter (for example, `debugContext.debugData.url co "/oauth/"`) returns an HTTP 400 error with a message that indicates the unsupported combination, for example:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000031",
  "errorSummary": "The supplied combination of operator and field is not currently supported. Operator: co, Field: debugContext.debugData.url",
  "errorId": "ec93dhe2-6d76-458c-8c0c-f8df8fb7a24b"
}
```

An internal service error returns the HTTP 500 error with the message:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "Sorry, there's been an error. We aren't sure what caused it, but we've logged this and will work to address it. Please try your request again.",
  "errorId": "55166534-b7d8-45a5-a4f6-3b38a5507046"
}
```

A timeout returns the HTTP 500 error with the message:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000009",
  "errorSummary": "Your last request took too long to complete. This is likely due to a load issue on our side. We've logged this and will work to address it. Please either simplify your query or wait a few minutes and try again."
}
```

A free-form query that's too long returns the following error message:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000001",
  "errorSummary": "Api validation failed: 'q': Freeform search cannot contain items longer than 40 characters. Please shorten the items in your search or use an advanced filter to query by specific fields."
}
```

Exceeding the rate limit returns the following error message:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000047",
  "errorSummary": "API call exceeded rate limit due to too many requests."
}
```

## Data retention

System Log data older than 90 days isn't returned, in accordance with Okta's [Data Retention Policy](https://support.okta.com/help/Documentation/Knowledge_Article/Okta-Data-Retention-Policy). Queries that exceed the retention period succeed, but only those results that have a `published` timestamp within the window are returned.

## Examples

### Debugging

Use the System Log API to troubleshoot user problems. For example, you can use the following `curl` command to see events from user "Jane Doe":

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?q=Jane+Doe"
```

You can also use this API to search for a particular type of event:

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?filter=event_type+eq+%22user.session.start%22"
```

Use the following call to search for System Log records that contain a specified keyword:

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?q=logout"

```

And use the following call to search for records from a specific date:

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?since=2014-09-01T00:00:00.000Z"
```
