# Manage multiple Okta environments tutorial 6: Schedule drift detection daily

> **Note:** This area is a work in progress. Please leave feedback on the content and format of this new type of architecture article by posting comments in the [Architecture area of the developer forums](https://devforum.okta.com/c/questions/architecture/24).

In the previous tutorial, you learned how to detect changes in the production environment and synchronize those changes back to your development environment. Now add a workflow to trigger a daily plan run through Terraform. Specifically, create a workflow to run a speculative plan to detect changes in the production environment daily at 0900 EST.

If any changes are detected, it sends a notification message to a Slack channel.

> **Note:** You have various options for where to send the notification. This example uses Slack. If you don't have Slack, it's easy to create a trial account if you want to follow along, or you can choose a different destination and use this example as a guide.

This simulates an enterprise that transforms to fully automated processes for detecting drift in your environments.

## Configure Terraform

To enable the Terraform workflow, you must create a [Team API token](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens#team-api-tokens) to allow access to both workspaces. You also need your workspace ID for the workflow.

To create a Team API token in Terraform Cloud:

1. Go to your top-level Terraform Workspaces page.
1. Navigate to **Settings > Teams**.
1. In the Team API Token section, click **Create a team token** to generate and display the token. You won't be able to see it again.

To find your Terraform workspace ID:

1. Go to your top-level Workspaces page.
1. Find the ID under your workspace's name.

## Create a workflow

1. Open the Admin Console for your production org.
1. Choose **Workflow** > **Workflows** to show the **Welcome to Workflows** page.
1. Select the **Flows** tab.
1. In the sidebar, click the **+** icon to add a new folder.
1. Set a folder name, for example, _Okta Configuration Drift_.
1. Click **Save** to finish creating the folder.

   <div class="full border">

   </div>

1. Click the name of your new folder in the sidebar to open it.
1. Import the workflow.
   1. Click the gear icon next to your folder name in the sidebar.

      <div class="full border">

      </div>

   1. Select **Import** in the menu to open an **Import** page.
   1. Navigate to your local copy of the github repo for this tutorial. Select `workflow/executeTerraformPlanToDetectDrift.flow` to import the example workflow.
1. In your new folder, observe that you imported one flow, it's a scheduled flow, and it's turned off.

## Update the workflow

Update the workflow before you run it.

1. Click the flow line to open the flow.
2. In the **Compose Post Body** card, set the `id` attribute to the Terraform workspace ID that you noted in [Configure Terraform](#configure-terraform).

   <div class="full border">

3. In the **Start a Run** card, authorize the Terraform Cloud connection.
   1. Click **Choose Connection**.
   2. Click **+ New Connection**.
   3. In the **New Connection** dialog:
      1. Optional. Enter a new name for **Connection Nickname**, for example, _Terraform Cloud_.
      2. Select **Custom for Auth Type**.
      3. Set **Header Name** to **Authorization**.
      4. Set **Header Value** to **Bearer** followed by a space and the Terraform Team API token that you created in [Configure Terraform](#configure-terraform).
      5. Click **Create**.

4. In the **Send Message to Channel** card, configure the output channel used for notifications when drift is detected.
   1. Click **Choose Connection**, select the channel you set up in [a Slack channel](/docs/reference/architecture-tutorials/mmod/lab-prerequisites/#a-slack-channel), and select your desired input and output fields.
   2. Click **Options** to choose your channel options (for example, select your channel ID for **Channel** and **Yes** for **send as bot**), and click **Save**.
   3. Pick a name for your Slack bot, for example, _Terraform-drift-bot_. This is used as the originator of the drift notification.
   4. Click **Save**.

This exercise demonstrates the process for Slack, but you can choose from many connection types. To select a different destination:

1. Open the Admin Console for your production org.
1. Choose **Workflows** > **Workflow console** to view the Workflows home page.
1. Select the **Connections** tab.
1. Click **+ New Connection** to open a **New Connection** page.
1. Select the desired connection type, for example, **Slack**.
1. Give the connection a nickname, for example, _Terraform Drift_.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Click **Allow** to give Slack access to the workflow.

   > **Tip:** Use the search field in the **New Connection** page to quickly find the best destination for you.

The connection is added to the **Connections** tab for the workflow.

## Test your changes

1. On the **Flows** tab, click the **ON/OFF** toggle to enable the workflow.
2. Select your workflow, and then click **Test** to run through the flow. The **Flow History** panel shows the results.

   </div>

3. If the result is **Success**, congratulations! If the result is an error, see the associated card for error information. Click the **ON/OFF** toggle to disable the flow, resolve the issue, and return to the first step in this section to retry the test. Repeat until the most recent (top) results are **Success**.
