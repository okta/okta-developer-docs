# Manage multiple Okta environments tutorial 5: Detect drift between environments and correct it

> **Note:** This area is a work in progress. Please leave feedback on the content and format of this new type of architecture article by posting comments in the [Architecture area of the developer forums](https://devforum.okta.com/c/questions/architecture/24).

Drift occurs when an Okta object changes in the destination (production) environment and is out of sync with its source (development) environment. This situation can occur during an outage when changes are made quickly to a production environment to restore service.

In this tutorial, you update a resource in production using the Admin Console, and then run a Terraform plan to detect if an asset has changed. If so, this tells the admin that someone has made a change without going through Terraform, and it needs to be investigated.

1. Preparation

   Display your workspace **Overview** page in a browser window. The **Latest Run** panel should reflect the results of your most recent run in the previous exercise.

   <div class="full border">

   </div>

1. In the Admin Console for your production org:
   1. Select **Directory** > **Groups**.
   1. On the **Groups** page, select **Renamed Test Group**.
   1. On the **Renamed Test Group** page, select the **Profile** tab.
   1. On the **Profile** panel, click **Edit**, set **Name** to **Newly Renamed Test Group**.
   1. Click **Save**.

1. On the **Latest Run** panel of the workspace **Overview** page for your production workspace, observe that a plan isn't run automatically.
1. On the workspace **Overview** page, click **Actions**, select **Start new run**, choose **Plan Only**, and click **Start run**.
1. Click **See details**. Observe that the plan runs and finishes, and then Terraform stops with the Apply pending.
1. When the plan finishes, observe that the **Plan finished** panel shows that the `okta_group.test_group` is changed.
1. On the workspace **Overview** page, observe that **Resources to be changed** shows that no resources would be added, one resource would be changed, and no resources would be deleted if you apply the changes.
1. Normally you would investigate the change and, if it's permitted, you would make sure that it's reflected in GitHub, if appropriate. In this case, if there are no errors, confirm and apply your changes:
   1. On the workspace **Runs** page, select the **Current Run**, if necessary.
   2. At the bottom of the run page, click **Confirm & Apply**.
   3. In the confirmation dialog, add a comment and click **Confirm Plan**.
   4. Verify that Apply completes successfully.
