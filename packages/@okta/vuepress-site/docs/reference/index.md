# Reference overview

Details on parameters, requests, and responses for Okta's API endpoints.

Okta APIs generally fall into one of two categories: signing in your users or managing
resources in your Okta org.

## Sign in your Users
API endpoints to authenticate your users, challenge for factors, recover passwords, and more.
  - The [Authentication Api](/docs/reference/api/authn) controls user accesss to Okta.
  - The [OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 API](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid) controls users access to your applications.

## Manage Okta objects
REST endpoints configure resources such as users, apps, sessions, and factors when needed.

For example, see the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users) for CRUD operations on users.
