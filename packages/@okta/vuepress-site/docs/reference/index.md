# Reference overview

Details on parameters, requests, and responses for Okta's API endpoints.


Okta APIs generally fall two categories: signing in your users, and managing
resources in your Okta org.

## Sign in your users
API endpoints authenticate your users, challenge for factors, recover passwords, and more.
  - The [Authentication API](/docs/reference/api/authn) controls user accesss to Okta.
  - The [OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 API](/docs/reference/api/oidc/) controls user access to your applications.

## Manage Okta objects
REST endpoints configure resources such as users, apps, sessions, and factors when needed.

For example, see the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users) for CRUD operations on users.
