### Other endpoints

This page provides the API rate Limits for other endpoint activities not covered in the [Authentication/End-user](/docs/reference/rl-global-enduser) and [Management](/docs/reference/rl-global-mgmt) categories and is part of Okta [rate limits](/docs/reference/rate-limits).

> We enforce limits at the individual API endpoint level **as requests per minute**.

> **Note:** For organizations created before 2018-05-17, the limit is 10,000 requests per minute. See [Previous rate limits](/docs/reference/rl-previous/).
