# Burst rate limits

To minimize impact on end users, Okta typically allows usage above the rate limits for any buckets containing authentication and/or authorization endpoints with the burst rate limit feature. This ensures any unplanned spike does not detrimentally affect the end user experience. By default, burst rate limits are:

* Scoped to organization wide buckets
* Extended a 5x multiplier
* Conditional on excess capacity available

In a scenario where the default rate limit for a bucket is exceeded, Okta will deliver a warning event, a burst event, and a violation event in the System Log and through an e-mail notification. For example, if the default rate limit is 600 requests per minute for the org-wide bucket `/api/v1/authn`. Then at 360 requests per minute, Okta would transmit a warning event (assuming the warning threshold is set at 60%), a burst event at 600 requests per minute and a violation event at 3000 requests per minute all in the same minute.

Burst rate limits can also be viewed on the APIs table on the Rate Limit Dashboard and the rate limit usage view for each bucket.
