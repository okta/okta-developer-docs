# APIs documented only on the new beta reference

We've got a new API reference in the works! With a fresh look and feel, our new API content features a more logical navigation and a wider variety of code examples. [Try the beta now](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/) and help us improve the site by [providing feedback](https://forms.gle/Y9XmNNTF2rPQwive7).

In some cases, APIs have only been documented on the new beta reference site, and not on the old API reference that you are currently looking at. This page provides a list of those, so that you can easily find them.
