# Classic Engine APIs

You can only use these APIs with Classic Engine:

- **Authentication API**: The Okta [Authentication API](/docs/reference/api/authn/) provides operations to authenticate users, perform multifactor enrollment and verification, recover forgotten passwords, and unlock accounts.

- **WebFinger**: The [WebFinger](/docs/reference/api/webfinger/) interface allows a client app to determine the Identity Provider that a given username (or identifier) should be routed to. This is based on your org's Identity Provider Routing Rules (IdP Discovery Policy). For an introduction to the topic, see [IdP Discovery](/docs/concepts/identity-providers/#idp-discovery).
