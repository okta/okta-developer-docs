title: Architecture Center
---

The Architecture Center is a reference point designed for solution engineers, architects, and DevOps staff. From here, you can discover how existing customers integrated Okta Workforce solutions into their systems. You can also access Docker-based tutorials that can help you understand how to better incorporate Okta into your own systems.

> **Note:** Find feedback and discussion about the Architecture Center in our [developer forums](https://devforum.okta.com/c/questions/architecture/24).

## Reference Architectures

These reference architectures describe common usage scenarios encountered by Okta customers. Each scenario explains a complete end to end implementation process.

* [Directory coexistence](/docs/reference/architecture-center/directory-coexistence): Minimize downtime while migrating user, group, and device profiles to Okta Universal Directory by keeping your source IAM servers active during the process.

* [Managing multiple Okta environments](/docs/reference/architecture-center/multiple-environments): Create solutions to deploy and manage multiple Okta environments with Terraform.

## Case Studies

These case studies explain how existing Okta customers implemented the tenets of a reference architecture into their own systems.
