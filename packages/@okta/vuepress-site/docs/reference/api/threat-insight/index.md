# ThreatInsight configuration API

The ThreatInsight API reference is now available at the new [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/ThreatInsight/).

Explore the [Okta Public API Collections](https://www.postman.com/okta-eng/workspace/okta-public-api-collections/overview) workspace to get started with the ThreatInsight API Postman collection.

<!--
[Okta ThreatInsight](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_threatinsight) maintains a constantly evolving list of IP addresses that consistently exhibit malicious activity. Authentication requests that are associated with an IP in this list can be logged to the [System Log](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Reports_SysLog) and blocked. ThreatInsight also covers non-authentication requests in limited capacity depending on the attack patterns of these malicious IPs.

The Okta ThreatInsight Configuration API provides operations to manage your ThreatInsight configuration.

> **Note:** To prevent abuse, Okta ThreatInsight works in a limited capacity for free trial edition orgs. Please contact Okta support if fully functional Okta ThreatInsight is required.

## ThreatInsight configuration object

| Field Name  | Description	| Data Type   | Required      |
| :---------- | :----------	| :---------- | :------------ |
| action         | Specifies how Okta responds to authentication requests from suspicious IPs. Supported values:<br><ul><li>`none`: Indicates that ThreatInsight is disabled</li><li>`audit`: Indicates that Okta logs suspicious requests to the System Log</li><li>`block`:  Indicates that Okta logs suspicious requests to the System Log and blocks the requests</li></ul> | String (enums: `none`, `audit`, or `block`) | Yes |
| excludeZones   | Accepts a list of [Network Zone](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/NetworkZone/) IDs.
