# Event Types

Event types are the primary method of categorization within the Okta eventing platform. They allow consumers to easily group notable system occurrences based on behavior. This resource contains the complete event type catalog of this platform.

## Catalog

The following is a full list of event types used in the [System Log API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SystemLog/) with associated descriptions and related metadata.

Download a CSV file with all event types: [Okta Event Types](/docs/okta-event-types.csv).
