# System Log API

The Okta System Log records system events related to your organization in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand platform activity and to diagnose problems.

The Okta System Log API provides near real-time read-only access to your organization's system log and is the programmatic counterpart of the [System Log UI](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_Reports_SysLog).

Often the terms "event" and "log event" are used interchangeably. In the context of this API, an "event" is an occurrence of interest within the system and "log" or "log event" is the recorded fact.

Notes on the System Log API:

* It contains much more [structured data](#logevent-object) than the [Events API](/docs/reference/api/events/#event-object).
* It supports additional [SCIM filters](#request-parameters) and the `q` query parameter, because of the presence of more structured data than the [Events API](/docs/reference/api/events/#request-parameters).
* Its primary supported use cases are:
  * Event data export into a security information and event management system (SIEM).
  * System monitoring.
  * Development debugging.
  * Event introspection and audit.
* It is not intended to be used as a Database as a Service (DBaaS), or otherwise directly serve data to downstream consumers without an intermediate data store.

For information on migrating from the Events API to the System Log API please see [Events API Migration](/docs/concepts/events-api-migration/).

## Getting Started

The System Log API has one endpoint:

<ApiOperation method="get" url="/api/v1/logs" />

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/54def5ab52f04b7e4011)

This collection resource is backed by a [LogEvent object](#logevent-object) and associated [event types](#event-types).

See [Examples](#examples) for ways you can use the System Log API. For common use cases see [Useful System Log Queries](https://support.okta.com/help/Documentation/Knowledge_Article/Useful-System-Log-Queries).

## LogEvent object

Each LogEvent object describes a single logged action or "event" performed by a set of actors for a set of targets.

### Target object

The entity upon which an actor performs an action. Targets may be anything: an app user, a login token or anything else.

| Property    | Description                                                  | DataType            | Nullable |

    "displayName": "Jon Stewart",
    "alternateId": "00uKrs9rsRSAXN",
    "login": "jon@example.com",
    "type": "User"
}
```

### Client object

When an event is triggered by an HTTP request, the `client` object describes the [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_clients) that issues that HTTP request. For instance, the web browser is the client when a user accesses Okta. When this request is received and processed, a login event is fired. When the event is not sourced to an HTTP request, such as in the case of an automatic update, the Client Object field is blank.

### UserAgent object

"A user agent is software (a software agent) that is acting on behalf of a user." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent))

In the Okta event data object, the UserAgent object provides specifications about the client software that makes event-triggering HTTP requests. User agent identification is often useful for identifying interoperability problems between servers and clients, and also for browser and operating system usage analytics.

| Property     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | DataType       | Nullable |

### Request object

The request object describes details related to the HTTP request that triggers this event, if available. When the event is not sourced to an http request, such as in the case of an automatic update on the Okta servers, the Request object will still exist, but the `ipChain` field will be empty.

| Property       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      | DataType                                | Nullable   |

| ipChain        | If the incoming request passes through any proxies, the IP addresses of those proxies will be stored here in the format (clientIp, proxy1, proxy2, ...). This field is useful when working with trusted proxies. | Array of [IpAddress](#ipaddress-object) | TRUE       |

### GeographicalContext object

Geographical Context describes a set of geographic coordinates. In addition to containing latitude and longitude data, this object also contains address data of postal code-level granularity. Within the [Client](#client-object) object, the geographical context refers to the physical location of the client when it sends the request that triggers this event. All [Transaction](#transaction-object) events with `type` equal to `WEB` will have a geographical context set. [Transaction](#transaction-object) events with `type` equal to `JOB` will have no geographical context set. The geographical context data could be missing if the geographical data for a request could not be resolved.

| Property    | Description                                                                                                          | DataType                                  | Nullable |

| state       | Full name of the state/province encompassing the area containing the geolocation coordinates (e.g. Montana, Incheon) | String                                    | TRUE     |
| country     | Full name of the country encompassing the area containing the geolocation coordinates (e.g. France, Uganda)          | String                                    | TRUE     |
| postalCode  | Postal code of the area encompassing the geolocation coordinates                                                     | String                                    | TRUE     |

### Geolocation object

Latitude and longitude of the geolocation where an action was performed, formatted according to the [ISO-6709](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6709) standard.

| Property   | Description                                                                                       | DataType        | Nullable |

| Property   | Description                                                            | DataType        | Nullable | Default | MinLength | MaxLength |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| result     | Result of the action: `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `SKIPPED`, `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `CHALLENGE`, `UNKNOWN`       | String          | FALSE    |         |           |           |
| reason     | Reason for the result, for example `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`               | String          | TRUE     |         | 1         | 255       |

### Transaction object

The `transaction` field contains a Transaction object.

A Transaction object comprises contextual information associated with its respective event. This information is useful for understanding sequences of correlated events (see [Event Correlation](#event-correlation) for more on this).

For example, a Transaction object such as:
```json
{
    "id": "Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo",
    "type": "WEB",
    "detail": null
}
```

indicates that a `WEB` request with `id` `Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo` created this event.

| Property   | Description                                                                                             | DataType             | Nullable |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| id         | Unique identifier for this transaction.                                                                 | String               | TRUE     |
| type       | Describes the kind of transaction. `WEB` indicates a web request. `JOB` indicates an asynchronous task. | String               | TRUE     |
| detail     | Details for this transaction.                                                                           | Map[String → Object] | TRUE     |

### DebugContext object

For some kinds of events (e.g. OMM provisioning, login, second factor SMS, etc.), the fields provided in other response objects will not be sufficient to adequately describe the operations the event has performed. In such cases, the `debugContext` object provides a way to store additional information.

For example, an event where a second factor SMS token is sent to a user might have a `debugContext` that looks like:

```json
{
    "debugData": {
        "requestUri": "/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify",
        "smsProvider": "TELESIGN",
        "transactionId": "268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4"
    }
}

```

By inspection of the `debugData` field, one can find the URI used to trigger the second factor SMS (`/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify`), the SMS provider (`TELESIGN`) and the ID used by Telesign to identify this transaction (`268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4`).

If for some reason the information needed to implement a feature is not provided in other response objects, it is advised to scan the `debugContext.debugData` field for potentially useful fields.

> Important: The information contained in `debugContext.debugData` is intended to add context when troubleshooting customer platform issues. Note that both key names and values may change from release to release and are not guaranteed to be stable. Therefore, they should not be viewed as a data contract but as a debugging aid instead.

| Property   | Description                                                                     | DataType            | Nullable |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------     | -------- |
| debugData  | Dynamic field containing miscellaneous information dependent on the event type. | Map[String->Object] | TRUE     |

### AuthenticationContext object

All authentication relies on validating one or more credentials that proves the authenticity of the actor's identity. Credentials are sometimes provided by the actor, as is the case with passwords, and at other times provided by a third party, and validated by the authentication provider.

The `authenticationContext` contains metadata about how the actor is authenticated. For example, an `authenticationContext` for an event in which a user authenticates with IWA will look something like:

```json
{
    "authenticationProvider": "ACTIVE_DIRECTORY",
    "authenticationStep": 0,
    "credentialProvider": null,
    "credentialType": "IWA",
    "externalSessionId": "102N1EKyPFERROGvK9wizMAPQ",
    "interface": null,
    "issuer": null
}
```
In such a case, one can recognize that the user used an IWA credential to authenticate against an Active Directory instance. All of the user's future generated events in this login session will share the same `externalSessionId`.

Among other operations, this response object can be used to scan for suspicious login activity or perform analytics on user authentication habits (e.g. how often authentication scheme X is used versus authentication scheme Y).

The `securityContext` object provides security information directly related to the evaluation of the event's IP reputation. IP reputation is a trustworthiness rating that evaluates how likely a sender is to be malicious based on the sender's IP address. As the name implies, the `securityContext` object is useful for security applications-flagging and inspecting suspicious events.

## Event Types

Event types categorize event instances by action and recorded in a LogEvent's [`eventType`](#attributes) attribute. They are key to navigating the system log via [Expression Filters](#expression-filter).

The following sections outline the key event types captured by the system log. For a complete listing see the [Event Types catalog](/docs/reference/api/event-types/#catalog).

* `policy.evaluate_sign_on` provides context on the values used and evaluated in the context of the Okta sign on policy. For example, you can determine which network zones were matched for this event.
* For `policy.lifecycle` and `policy.rule` events, the corresponding policy is listed in the target object.

### System Events

| Event                                | Description                                                                                                                  |

| system.org.rate_limit.warning        | An endpoint is near its [rate limit](/docs/reference/rate-limits/).                                                 |
| system.org.rate_limit.violation      | An endpoint has exceeded its [rate limit](/docs/reference/rate-limits/).                                            |
| core.concurrency.org.limit.violation | A request has exceeded the org's allotted [concurrency limit](/docs/reference/rate-limits/#concurrent-rate-limits). |

Rate limit warnings are sent at different times, depending on the org type. For One App and Enterprise orgs, the warning is sent when the org is at 60% of its limit.

> **Note:** For orgs created before 2018-05-17, the warning is sent at 90%.

Rate limit violations are sent when a rate limit is exceeded.

### Security Events

| Event                    | Description                                                                                   |

| security.request.blocked | A request was blocked due to a block list rule (such as an IP network zone or location rule). |

### User Events

| Event                       | Description                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| user.authentication.sso     | A user attempted to SSO to an application managed in Okta |
| user.lifecycle.activate     | A user account was activated.                             |
| user.lifecycle.create       | A user account was created.                               |

| user.lifecycle.suspend      | A user account was suspended.                             |
| user.lifecycle.unsuspend    | A user account was moved from suspended status.           |
| user.session.start          | Okta issued a session to a user who is authenticating     |

#### User Event Details

* `user.authentication.sso` doesn't capture whether the SSO attempt was successful or failed because Okta can't collect the subsequent authentication attempt status from the third-party service.


## Event Correlation

When looking through the System Log, it is often useful to be able to correlate events to understand the thread of events that happened at a particular time.

The `LogResponse` object offers two identifiers in this respect:
  - `authenticationContext.externalSessionId`: identifies events that occurred in the same user session.
  - `transaction.id`: identifies events that occurred together as part of an operation (for example, a request to Okta's servers).

### Event Correlation Example

The table below shows 18 events produced from 13 transactions over 6 different sessions, all performed by one user. Note that `authenticationContext.externalSessionId` is abbreviated to `sessionId` in this table.

| sessionId                   | transaction.id                | uuid                                   | eventType                                     | displayMessage                        |

{.table-word-break}

As evidenced by the `null` `authenticationContext.externalSessionId` field in the last row, neither `transaction.id` nor `uuid` maintain a many-to-one relationship with `authenticationContext.externalSessionId`. In this particular case, the `null` `authenticationContext.externalSessionId` field can be explained by a failed user login. There was no session granted to the user's client since the login failed.

##### Request Types

All requests to the `/api/v1/logs` endpoint fall into one of these two categories:
  - [Polling Requests](#polling-requests)
  - [Bounded Requests](#bounded-requests)

###### Polling Requests
Polling requests are for situations when you want to consume an ongoing stream of events from Okta.

Example use cases include:
  - [Ingesting System Log data into an external SIEM system](#transferring-data-to-a-separate-system).
  - Utilizing System Log data for real-time monitoring.

For a request to be a _polling_ request it must meet the following request parameter criteria:
  - `until` must be unspecified.
  - `sortOrder` must be `ASCENDING`.

Polling requests to the `/api/v1/logs` API have the following semantics:
  - They return every event that occurs in your organization.
  - The returned events are time filtered by their internal "persistence time" to avoid skipping records due to system delays (unlike [Bounded Requests](#bounded-requests)).
  - They may return events out of order according to the `published` field.
  - They have an infinite number of pages. That is, a [`next` `link` relation header](#next-link-response-header) is always present, even if there are no new events (the event list may be empty).

###### Bounded Requests
Bounded requests are for situations when you know the definite time period of logs you want to retrieve.

Example use cases include:
  - [Debugging or troubleshooting system behavior](#debugging).
  - Auditing events that happened at a particular time.

For a request to be a _bounded_ request it must meet the following request parameter criteria:
  - `since` must be specified.
  - `until` must be specified.

Bounded requests to the `/api/v1/logs` API have the following semantics:
  - The returned events are time filtered by their associated `published` field (unlike [Polling Requests](#polling-requests)).
  - The returned events are guaranteed to be in order according to the `published` field.
  - They have a finite number of pages. That is, the last page does not contain a [`next` `link` relation header](#next-link-response-header).
  - Not all events for the specified time range may be present— events may be delayed. Such delays are rare but possible.


##### Filtering Results

###### Expression Filter

An expression filter is useful for performing structured queries where constraints on LogEvent attribute values can be explicitly targeted.

The following expressions are supported for events with the `filter` query parameter:

| Filter                                       | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `eventType eq ":eventType"`                  | Events that have a specific action [eventType](#attributes)                    |
| `target.id eq ":id"`                         | Events published with a specific target id                                     |
| `actor.id eq ":id"`                          | Events published with a specific actor id                                      |

> Note that SCIM filter expressions cannot use the `published` attribute since it may conflict with the logic of the `since`, `after`, and `until` query params.

See [Filtering](/docs/reference/api-overview/#filtering) for more information about expressions.

The following are some examples of common filter expressions.

Events published for a target user:
```javascript
filter=target.id eq "00uxc78lMKUMVIHLTAXY"
```

Failed login events:
```javascript
filter=eventType eq "user.session.start" and outcome.result eq "FAILURE"
```

Events published for a target user and application:
```javascript
filter=target.id eq "00uxc78lMKUMVIHLTAXY" and target.id eq "0oabe82gnXOFVCDUMVAK"
```

App SSO events for a target user and application:
```javascript
filter=eventType eq "app.auth.sso" and target.id eq "00uxc78lMKUMVIHLTAXY" and target.id eq "0oabe82gnXOFVCDUMVAK"
```

Events published for a given ip address:
```javascript
filter=client.ipAddress eq "184.73.186.14"
```

###### Keyword Filter

The query parameter `q` can be used to perform keyword matching against a LogEvents object's attribute values. In order to satisfy the constraint, all supplied keywords must be matched exactly.
Note that matching is case-insensitive.

The following are some examples of common keyword filtering:

* Events that mention a specific city: `q=San Francisco`
* Events that mention a specific url: `q=interestingURI.com`
* Events that mention a specific person: `q=firstName lastName`

> **Note:** When hyphens are present in an event instance's attribute value they are split and added to the list of matching candidates, in addition to the full hyphenated value. Thus a `q` value of `XOxBw-2JIRnCFd0gG0GjHAAABjY` would match events containing the text `XOxBw`, `2JIRnCFd0gG0GjHAAABjY`, or `XOxBw-2JIRnCFd0gG0GjHAAABjY`.

###### Datetime Filter

LogEvent objects can be filtered by [`published`](#attributes) attribute value with the following combination of parameters:

* `since`
* `until`
* `since` and `until`
* `after`

Note that `since` and `after` are mutually exclusive and cannot be specified simultaneously.

The `after` parameter is system generated for use in ["next" links](#next-link-response-header). Users should not attempt to craft requests using this value and rely on the system generated links instead.

##### Response


The response contains a JSON array of [LogEvent objects](#logevent-object).

###### Self Link Response Header
The response always includes a `self` `link` header, which is a link to the current query that was executed.

This header is of the form:
```
link: <url>; rel="self"
```

For example:
```
link: <https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?q=&sortOrder=DESCENDING&limit=20&until=2017-09-17T23%3A59%3A59%2B00%3A00&since=2017-06-10T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00>; rel="self"
```

###### Next Link Response Header
The response may include a `next` `link` header, which is a link to the next page of results, if there is one. Note that while the `self` `link` will always exist, the `next` `link` may not exist.

This header is of the form:
```
link: <url>; rel="next"
```

For example:
```
link: <https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?q=&sortOrder=DESCENDING&limit=20&until=2017-09-17T15%3A41%3A12.994Z&after=349996bd-5091-45dc-a39f-d357867a30d7&since=2017-06-10T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00>; rel="next"
```

#### Timeouts
Individual queries have a timeout of 30 seconds.

### Errors
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000001",
  "errorSummary": "Api validation failed: 'until': The date format in your query is not recognized. Please enter dates using ISO8601 string format.. 'until': must be a valid date-time or empty.",
  "errorId": "dd4998a1-2267-499b-9e4d-ec821fcc5ca9",
  "errorCauses": [
    {
      "errorSummary": "until: The date format in your query is not recognized. Please enter dates using ISO8601 string format."
    },
    {
      "errorSummary": "until: must be a valid date-time or empty."
    }
  ]
}
```

An invalid SCIM filter returns a 400 with a description of the issue with the SCIM filter. For example:
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "Invalid filter 'display_message eqq \"Create okta user\"': Unrecognized attribute operator 'eqq' at position 16. Expected: eq,co,sw,pr,gt,ge,lt,le",
  "errorId": "eb83dfe1-6d76-458c-8c0c-f8df8fb7a24b"
}
```

An Invalid field returns a 400 with a message indicating which field is invalid. For example:
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "field is not valid: some_invalid_field",
  "errorId": "ec93dhe2-6d76-458c-8c0c-f8df8fb7a24b"
}
```

Another example, where the parameters are invalid:
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "Invalid parameter: The since parameter is over 180 days prior to the current day.",
  "errorId": "55166534-b7d8-45a5-a4f6-3b38a5507046"
}
```

An internal service error returns a 500 with the message:
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000053",
  "errorSummary": "Sorry, there's been an error. We aren't sure what caused it, but we've logged this and will work to address it. Please try your request again.",
  "errorId": "55166534-b7d8-45a5-a4f6-3b38a5507046"
}
```

A timeout returns a 500 with the message:
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000009",
  "errorSummary": "Your last request took too long to complete. This is likely due to a load issue on our side. We've logged this and will work to address it. Please either simplify your query or wait a few minutes and try again."
}
```

A free form query that is too long:
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000001",
  "errorSummary": "Api validation failed: 'q': Freeform search cannot contain items longer than 40 characters. Please shorten the items in your search or use an advanced filter to query by specific fields."
}
```

Exceeding the rate limit results in:
```json
{
  "errorCode": "E0000047",
  "errorSummary": "API call exceeded rate limit due to too many requests."
}
```

### Rate Limits

See the tables entries for `/api/v1/logs` in [Rate Limits](/docs/reference/rate-limits/) for details.

## Data Retention

Log data older than 90 days is not returned, in accordance with Okta's [Data Retention Policy](https://support.okta.com/help/Documentation/Knowledge_Article/Okta-Data-Retention-Policy). Queries that exceed the retention period will succeed but only results that have a `published` timestamp within the window will be returned.

## Examples

### Debugging
The System Log API can be used to troubleshoot user problems. For example, you
can use the following `curl` command to see events from user "Jane Doe":

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?q=Jane+Doe"
```

You can also use this API to search for particular types of events:

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?filter=event_type+eq+%22user.session.start%22"
```

### Transferring Data to a Separate System
You can export your log events to a separate system for analysis or compliance. To obtain the entire dataset, query from the appropriate point of time in the past.

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
"https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/logs?since=2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"
```

and retrieve the next page of events through the [`link` response header](/docs/reference/api-overview/#link-header) value with the `next` link relation. Continue this process until no events are returned.

> Do not attempt to transfer data by manually paginating using `since` and `until` as this may lead to skipped or duplicated events. Instead, always follow the `next` links.
