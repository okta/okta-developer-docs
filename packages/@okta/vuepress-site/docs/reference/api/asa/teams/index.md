# ASA Teams API

The ASA Teams API reference is now available at the [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/asa/asa/tag/teams/).

Explore the [Advanced Server Access Collection](https://www.postman.com/okta-eng/workspace/okta-public-api-collections/collection/4920859-f91736f1-5ae0-4a0a-949d-abed2ada2c58) in the Okta Public API Collections workspace.

<!--
## Get started

The [Advanced Server Access (ASA) API](/docs/reference/api/asa/introduction/) is logically separate from the rest of the Okta APIs and uses a different API namespace:

`https://app.scaleft.com/v1/`

An Advanced Server Access (ASA) Team is the top-level organizational concept in ASA. Each ASA Team maps to a single app in the Okta dashboard.

All other configuration objects in Advanced Server Access are scoped to an ASA Team.

## Teams API operations

The Teams API has the following operations:

* [List Servers for a Team](#list-servers-for-a-team)
* [Update a Server](#update-a-server)
* [Fetch Team settings](#fetch-team-settings)
* [Update Team settings](#update-team-settings)
* [Fetch statistics for a Team](#fetch-statistics-for-a-team)
