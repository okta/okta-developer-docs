# ASA Clients API

The ASA Clients API reference is now available at the [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/asa/asa/tag/clients/).

Explore the [Advanced Server Access Collection](https://www.postman.com/okta-eng/workspace/okta-public-api-collections/collection/4920859-f91736f1-5ae0-4a0a-949d-abed2ada2c58) in the Okta Public API Collections workspace.

<!--
## Get started

The [Advanced Server Access (ASA) API](/docs/reference/api/asa/introduction/) is logically separate from the rest of the Okta APIs and uses a different API namespace:

`https://app.scaleft.com/v1/`

An Advanced Server Access (ASA) Client corresponds to a user's device. Clients are the primary way users access servers managed by ASA.
