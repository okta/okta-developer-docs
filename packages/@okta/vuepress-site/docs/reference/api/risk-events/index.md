# Risk Events API

The Risk Events API reference is now available at the new [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RiskEvent/#tag/RiskEvent).

Explore the [Okta Public API Collections](https://www.postman.com/okta-eng/workspace/okta-public-api-collections/overview) workspace to get started with the Risk Events API Postman collection.

<!--
<ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

The Okta Risk Events API provides the ability for third-party Risk Providers to send Risk Events to Okta.

## Get Started
Explore the Risk Events API: [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/1c449b51a4a0adf90198)

See [Third-party risk provider integration overview](/docs/guides/third-party-risk-integration/) for guidance on integrating third-party risk providers with Okta.

## Risk Events Operations
The Risk Events API has the following operations:

* [Send Risk Events](#send-risk-events)


### Send Risk Events

<ApiOperation method="post" url="/api/v1/risk/events/ip" />

A Risk Provider can send Risk Events to Okta using this API.
This API has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute. The caller should include multiple Risk Events in a single payload to reduce
the number of API calls. If a client has more risk signals to send than what the API supports, we recommend prioritizing posting high risk signals.

#### Request body

The request body should include an array of [Risk Events](#risk-event-object). A maximum of 20 events can be included in a request. Each Risk Event can include the following properties:

| Property    | Type           | Description   |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `timestamp` | String | Time stamp at which the the event is produced (Expressed as a UTC time zone using ISO 8601 format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'). This is an optional field. |
| `expiresAt` | String | Time stamp at which the event expires (Expressed as a UTC time zone using ISO 8601 format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'). If this optional field is not included, Okta automatically expires the event 24 hours after the event is consumed. |
| `subjects` | List | List of [Risk Subjects](#risk-subject-object). A max of 50 subjects can be included in an event |

#### Response body

Http 202 (Accepted) is returned if the request is successful. If there are validation errors, the API returns a 400.
