# Identity Threat Protection Event Types

This resource contains detailed reference material on event types triggered with the Identity Threat Protection solution. Use the information from these properties to understand the users, threats, and risk environment for your org.

>**Note:** Not every property is documented for the event types. Only those primarily used to assist in reviewing an identity threat interaction. Also, objects and properties may differ based on your implementation of the Identity Threat Protection solution.

## analytics feedback provide
`analytics.feedback.provide`

**Description:** This event is triggered when an admin provides feedback on a user or session risk detection. It can be used to monitor feedback provided by admins in response to Okta-determined changes in risk.

| Key event properties  | Description                                         | Data type      | Example values |

| EventUuid              | The ID of the `user.risk.change` or `session.context.change` event that prompted the Admin feedback.               | String         | `721b1961-f0a6-11ee-bfa6-c1c3bad801v3`        |
| Label              | The type of feedback from the admin, either `true_positive` or `false_positive`                | Enum         |  `true_positive`        |

| type        | The type of actor object           |      |        |

## device signals status timeout
`device.signals.status.timeout`

**Description:** This event is triggered when a registered device that is associated with at least one user session hasn't communicated with Okta within the required time interval. Use this event to investigate a potentially insecure device and compromised user session. The event contains the device unique identifier in the System Log actor object. You can use this information to find other related events.

**Description:** This event is triggered when your orgâ€™s authentication or global session policy is reevaluated, and a violation is identified. The violation occurs if the request doesn't meet the assurances defined in the policy, or if the request has an action set to `DENY` based on environment conditions.

## user session end
`user.session.end`

**Description:** This event is triggered when Okta terminates all IDX sessions for a user. A separate event is logged for each of the user's active sessions. Each event contains `externalSessionId` and `System.Transaction.ID` values that correlate with the `System.Transaction.ID` for the `user.session.clear` event.

## workflows user delegatedflow run
`workflows.user.delegatedflow.run`

**Description:** This event can be used by admins or security team members to monitor the execution of delegated flows in the Workflows platform from the Admin Console. The actor field provides the Okta User ID of the user that ran the flow. The target fields provide context on the Workflows instance and the name and flow ID of the executed flow. The event only indicates if the flow was successfully triggered and doesn't provide information about whether the flow encountered an error.
