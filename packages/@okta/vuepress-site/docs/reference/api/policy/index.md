# Policy API

The Okta Policy API enables an Administrator to perform Policy and Policy Rule operations. The Policy framework is used by Okta to control Rules and settings that govern, among other things, user session lifetime, whether multi-factor authentication is required when logging in, what MFA factors may be employed, password complexity requirements, what types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances, and what identity provider to route users to.

Policy settings for a particular Policy type, such as Sign On Policy, consist of one or more Policy objects, each of which contains one or more Policy Rules.  Policies and Rules contain conditions that determine whether they are applicable to a particular user at a particular time.

The Policy API supports the following **Policy operations**:

* Get all policies of a specific type
* Create, read, update, and delete a Policy
* Activate and deactivate a Policy

The Policy API supports the following **Rule operations**:

* Get all Rules for a Policy
* Create, read, update, and delete a Rule for a Policy
* Activate and deactivate a Rule

## Policies

### Policy evaluation

When a Policy needs to be retrieved for a particular user, for example when the user attempts to sign in to Okta, or when the user initiates a self-service operation, then a Policy evaluation takes place.
During Policy evaluation each Policy of the appropriate type is considered in turn, in the order indicated by the Policy priority. Each of the conditions associated with the Policy is evaluated. If one or more of the conditions can't be met, then the next Policy in the list is considered. If the conditions can be met, then each of the Rules associated with the Policy is considered in turn, in the order specified by the Rule priority. Each of the conditions associated with a given Rule is evaluated. If all of the conditions associated with a Rule are met, then the settings contained in the Rule, and in the associated Policy, are applied to the user. If none of the Policy Rules have conditions that can be met, then the next Policy in the list is considered.

Policies that have no Rules aren't considered during evaluation and are never applied.

### Policy types

Different Policy types control settings for different operations. All Policy types share a common framework, message structure, and API, but have different Policy settings and Rule data. The data structures specific to each Policy type are discussed in the various sections below.

[Okta Sign On Policy](#okta-sign-on-policy)

[Okta MFA Policy](#multifactor-mfa-enrollment-policy)

[Password Policy](#password-policy)

[IdP Discovery Policy](#idp-discovery-policy)

[OAuth Authorization Policy](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/#policy-object)

### Policy priority and defaults

### Default Policies

There is always a default Policy created for each type of Policy. The default Policy applies to any users for whom other Policies in the Okta org don't apply. This ensures that there is always a Policy to apply to a user in all situations.

 - A default Policy is required and can't be deleted.
 - The default Policy is always the last Policy in the priority order. Any added Policies of this type have higher priority than the default Policy.
 - The default Policy always has one default Rule that can't be deleted. It is always the last Rule in the priority order. If you add Rules to the default Policy, they have a higher priority than the default Rule. For information on default Rules, see [Rules object and defaults](#rules-object).
 - The `system` attribute determines whether a Policy is created by a system or by a user.

### Policy priorities

Policies are ordered numerically by priority. This priority determines the order in which they are evaluated for a context match. The highest priority Policy has a `priority` of 1.

For example, assume the following Policies exist.

- Policy A has priority 1 and applies to members of the "Administrators" group.
- Policy B has priority 2 and applies to members of the "Everyone" group.

When a Policy is evaluated for a user, Policy "A" is evaluated first. If the user is a member of the "Administrators" group, then the Rules associated with Policy "A" are evaluated. If a match is found, then the Policy settings are applied. If the user isn't a member of the "Administrators" group, then Policy B is evaluated.

### Policy Settings object

The Policy Settings object contains the Policy level settings for the particular Policy type. Not all Policy types have Policy-level settings. For example, in a Password Policy the settings object contains, among other items, the password complexity settings. In a Sign On Policy, on the other hand, there are no Policy-level settings. All of the Policy data is contained in the Rules. Each Policy type section explains the settings objects specific to that type.

### Conditions object

The Conditions object specifies the conditions that must be met during Policy evaluation to apply the Policy in question. All Policy conditions, as well as conditions for at least one Rule must be met to apply the settings specified in the Policy and the associated Rule. Policies and Rules may contain different conditions depending on the Policy type. The conditions that can be used with a particular Policy depend on the Policy type. See [conditions](#conditions).

### Links object

Specifies Link relations (See [Web Linking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)) available for the current Policy. The Links object is used for dynamic discovery of related resources. The Links object is **read-only**.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                     | Data Type | Required |
| ---        | ---                                                                             | ---       | ---      |
| self       | The Policy or Rule                                                              | String    | Yes      |
| activate   | Action to activate a Policy or Rule (present if the Rule is currently inactive) | String    | Yes      |
| deactivate | Action to deactivate a Policy or Rule (present if the Rule is currently active) | String    | Yes      |
| rules      | Action to retrieve the Rules objects for the given Policy                       | String    | Yes      |

## Rules

Each Policy may contain one or more Rules. Rules, like Policies, contain conditions that must be satisfied for the Rule to be applied.

### Rule priority and defaults

### Default Rules

 - Only the default Policy contains a default Rule. You can edit or delete the default Rule.
 - The default Rule is required and always is the last Rule in the priority order. If you add Rules to the default Policy, they have a higher priority than the default Rule.
 - The `system` attribute determines whether a Rule is created by a system or by a user. The default Rule is the only Rule that has this attribute.

### Rule priority

Like Policies, Rules have a priority that govern the order that they are considered during evaluation. The highest priority Rule has a `priority` of 1. For example, if a particular Policy had two Rules:

- Rule A has priority 1 and applies to RADIUS VPN scenarios.
- Rule B has priority 2 and applies to ANYWHERE (network connection) scenarios.

If a request came in from the Radius endpoint, the action in Rule A is taken, and Rule B isn't evaluated. This occurs because even though requests coming from anywhere  match the ANYWHERE location condition of Rule B, Rule A has higher priority and is evaluated first.

### Actions objects

Just as Policies contain settings, Rules contain "Actions" that typically specify actions to be taken, or operations that may be allowed, if the Rule conditions are satisfied. For example, in a Password Policy, Rule actions govern whether self-service operations such as reset password or unlock are permitted. Just as different Policy types have different settings, Rules have different actions depending on the type of Policy that they belong to.

### Conditions object

The Conditions object specifies the conditions that must be met during Policy evaluation to apply the Rule in question. All Policy conditions, as well as conditions for at least one Rule must be met to apply the settings specified in the Policy and the associated Rule. Policies and Rules may contain different conditions depending on the Policy type. The conditions that can be used with a particular Policy depend on the Policy type. See [conditions](#conditions).

### Links object

## Type-Specific Policy data structures

## Okta Sign On Policy

Okta Sign On Policy controls the manner in which a user is allowed to sign on to Okta, including whether they are challenged for multifactor authentication (MFA) and how long they are allowed to remain signed in before re-authenticating.

> **Note:** Okta Sign On Policy is different from an application sign-on Policy, which determines the extra levels of authentication (if any) that must be performed before a specific Okta application can be invoked. An application sign-on Policy can't be configured through the API.

### Policy Settings data

The Okta Sign On Policy doesn't contain Policy Settings data. All of the data is contained in the Rules.

### Policy conditions

The following conditions may be applied to the Okta Sign On Policy.

[People Condition](#people-condition-object)

### Okta Sign On Rules action data

### Rules conditions

The following conditions may be applied to the Rules associated with MFA Enrollment Policy:

* [People Condition](#people-condition-object)

* [Network Condition](#network-condition-object)

## Password Policy

The Password Policy determines the requirements for a user's password length and complexity, as well as the frequency with which a password must be changed. This Policy also governs the recovery operations that may be performed by the User, including change password, reset (forgot) password, and self-service password unlock.

> **Note:** Password Policies are enforced only for Okta and AD-mastered users. For AD-mastered users, ensure that your Active Directory Policies don't conflict with the Okta Policies.

Users can be routed to a variety of identity providers (`SAML2`, `IWA`, `AgentlessDSSO`, `X509`, `FACEBOOK`, `GOOGLE`, `LINKEDIN`, `MICROSOFT`, `OIDC`) based on multiple conditions. For an introduction to the topic, see [IdP Discovery](/docs/concepts/identity-providers/#idp-discovery).

All Okta orgs contain one and only one IdP Discovery Policy, with an immutable default Rule routing to your org's sign-in page.

### Policy conditions

The following conditions may be applied to IdP Discovery Policy:

* [Network Condition](#network-condition-object)

* [Platform Condition](#platform-condition-object)

* [User Identifier Condition](#user-identifier-condition-object)

* [Application and App Instance Condition](#application-and-app-instance-condition-object)

### Policy Action data

#### Policy Action object

| Property  | Description                                                          | Data Type | Required |
| ---       | ---                                                                  | ---       | ---      |
| providers | List of configured identity providers that a given Rule can route to | array     | Yes      |

> **Note:** Currently, this `providers` list only supports one value. IdP types `OKTA`, `AgentlessDSSO`, and `IWA` don't require an `id`.
