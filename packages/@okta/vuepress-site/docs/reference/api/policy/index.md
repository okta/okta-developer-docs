# Policy API

The Okta Policy API enables an Administrator to perform Policy and Policy Rule operations. The Policy framework is used by Okta to control Rules and settings that govern, among other things, user session lifetime, whether multi-factor authentication is required when logging in, what MFA factors may be employed, password complexity requirements, what types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances, and what identity provider to route users to.

Policy settings for a particular Policy type, such as Sign On Policy, consist of one or more Policy objects, each of which contains one or more Policy Rules.  Policies and Rules contain conditions that determine whether they are applicable to a particular user at a particular time.

The Policy API supports the following **Policy operations**:

* Get all policies of a specific type
* Create, read, update, and delete a Policy
* Get all apps assigned to a specific policy
* Activate and deactivate a Policy

The Policy API supports the following **Rule operations**:

* Get all Rules for a Policy
* Create, read, update, and delete a Rule for a Policy
* Activate and deactivate a Rule

## Policies

### Policy evaluation

When a Policy needs to be retrieved for a particular user, for example when the user attempts to sign in to Okta, or when the user initiates a self-service operation, then a Policy evaluation takes place.
During Policy evaluation each Policy of the appropriate type is considered in turn, in the order indicated by the Policy priority. Each of the conditions associated with the Policy is evaluated. If one or more of the conditions can't be met, then the next Policy in the list is considered. If the conditions can be met, then each of the Rules associated with the Policy is considered in turn, in the order specified by the Rule priority. Each of the conditions associated with a given Rule is evaluated. If all of the conditions associated with a Rule are met, then the settings contained in the Rule, and in the associated Policy, are applied to the user. If none of the Policy Rules have conditions that can be met, then the next Policy in the list is considered.

Policies that have no Rules aren't considered during evaluation and are never applied.

### Policy types

Different Policy types control settings for different operations. All Policy types share a common framework, message structure, and API, but have different Policy settings and Rule data. The data structures specific to each Policy type are discussed in the various sections below.

* [Global session policy](#global-session-policy)
* [Authenticator enrollment policy](#authenticator-enrollment-policy) <ApiLifecycle access="ie" />
* [Okta MFA Enrollment Policy](#multifactor-mfa-enrollment-policy)
* [Password Policy](#password-policy)
* [IdP Discovery Policy](#idp-discovery-policy)
* [OAuth Authorization Policy](/docs/reference/api/authorization-servers/#policy-object)
* [Authentication Policy](#authentication-policy) <ApiLifecycle access="ie" /><br>
* [Profile Enrollment Policy](#profile-enrollment-policy) <ApiLifecycle access="ie" /><br>

### Policy priority and defaults

### Default Policies

There is always a default Policy created for each type of Policy. The default Policy applies to new applications by default or any users for whom other Policies in the Okta org don't apply. This ensures that there is always a Policy to apply to a user in all situations.

 - A default Policy is required and can't be deleted.
 - New applications (other than Office365, Radius, and MFA) are assigned to the default Policy.
 - The default Policy is always the last Policy in the priority order. Any added Policies of this type have higher priority than the default Policy.
 - The default Policy always has one default Rule that can't be deleted. It is always the last Rule in the priority order. If you add Rules to the default Policy, they have a higher priority than the default Rule. For information on default Rules, see [Rules object and defaults](#rules-object).
 - The `system` attribute determines whether a Policy is created by a system or by a user.

### Policy priorities

Policies are ordered numerically by priority. This priority determines the order in which they are evaluated for a context match. The highest priority Policy has a `priority` of 1.

For example, assume the following Policies exist.

- Policy A has priority 1 and applies to members of the "Administrators" group.
- Policy B has priority 2 and applies to members of the "Everyone" group.

When a Policy is evaluated for a user, Policy "A" is evaluated first. If the user is a member of the "Administrators" group, then the Rules associated with Policy "A" are evaluated. If a match is found, then the Policy settings are applied. If the user isn't a member of the "Administrators" group, then Policy B is evaluated.

### Policy Settings object

The Policy Settings object contains the Policy level settings for the particular Policy type. Not all Policy types have Policy-level settings. For example, in a Password Policy the settings object contains, among other items, the password complexity settings. In a Sign On Policy, on the other hand, there are no Policy-level settings. All of the Policy data is contained in the Rules. Each Policy type section explains the settings objects specific to that type.

### Conditions object

The Conditions object specifies the conditions that must be met during Policy evaluation to apply the Policy in question. All Policy conditions, as well as conditions for at least one Rule must be met to apply the settings specified in the Policy and the associated Rule. Policies and Rules may contain different conditions depending on the Policy type. The conditions that can be used with a particular Policy depend on the Policy type. See [conditions](#conditions).

### Links object

Specifies Link relations (see [Web Linking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288) available for the current Policy. The Links object is used for dynamic discovery of related resources. The Links object is **read-only**.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                     | Data Type | Required |
| ---        | ---                                                                             | ---       | ---      |
| self       | The Policy or Rule                                                              | String    | Yes      |
| activate   | Action to activate a Policy or Rule (present if the Rule is currently inactive) | String    | Yes      |
| deactivate | Action to deactivate a Policy or Rule (present if the Rule is currently active) | String    | Yes      |
| rules      | Action to retrieve the Rules objects for the given Policy                       | String    | Yes      |

## Rules

Each Policy may contain one or more Rules. Rules, like Policies, contain conditions that must be satisfied for the Rule to be applied.

### Rule priority and defaults

### Default Rules

 - Only the default Policy contains a default Rule. You can edit or delete the default Rule.
 - The default Rule is required and always is the last Rule in the priority order. If you add Rules to the default Policy, they have a higher priority than the default Rule.
 - The `system` attribute determines whether a Rule is created by a system or by a user. The default Rule is the only Rule that has this attribute.

### Rule priority

Like Policies, Rules have a priority that govern the order that they are considered during evaluation. The highest priority Rule has a `priority` of 1. For example, if a particular Policy had two Rules:

- Rule A has priority 1 and applies to LDAP API scenarios.
- Rule B has priority 2 and applies to ANYWHERE (network connection) scenarios.

If a request came in from the LDAP endpoint, the action in Rule A is taken, and Rule B isn't evaluated. This occurs because even though requests coming from anywhere  match the ANYWHERE location condition of Rule B, Rule A has higher priority and is evaluated first.

| _links        | Hyperlinks                                                         | [Links object](#links-object-2)                | No         |                        |

### Actions objects

Just as Policies contain settings, Rules contain "Actions" that typically specify actions to be taken, or operations that may be allowed, if the Rule conditions are satisfied. For example, in a Password Policy, Rule actions govern whether self-service operations such as reset password or unlock are permitted. Just as different Policy types have different settings, Rules have different actions depending on the type of Policy that they belong to.

### Conditions object

The Conditions object specifies the conditions that must be met during Policy evaluation to apply the Rule in question. All Policy conditions, as well as conditions for at least one Rule must be met to apply the settings specified in the Policy and the associated Rule. Policies and Rules may contain different conditions depending on the Policy type. The conditions that can be used with a particular Policy depend on the Policy type. See [conditions](#conditions).

### Links object

Specifies link relations (see [Web Linking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288)) available for the current Rule. The Links object is used for dynamic discovery of related resources. The Links object is **read-only**.

## Type-Specific Policy data structures

## Global session policy

> **Note:** In Identity Engine, the Okta Sign On Policy name has changed to global session policy. The policy type of `OKTA_SIGN_ON` remains unchanged.

Global session policy controls the manner in which a user is allowed to sign in to Okta, including whether they are challenged for multifactor authentication (MFA) and how long they are allowed to remain signed in before re-authenticating.

> **Note:** Global session policy is different from an application-level authentication policy. An authentication policy determines the extra levels of authentication (if any) that must be performed before a specific Okta application can be invoked.

### Policy Settings data

The global session policy doesn't contain Policy Settings data. All of the data is contained in the Rules.

### Policy conditions

The following conditions may be applied to the global session policy.

## Authenticator enrollment policy

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

> **Note:** In Identity Engine, the Multifactor (MFA) Enrollment Policy name has changed to authenticator enrollment policy. The policy type of `MFA_ENROLL` remains unchanged, however, the `settings` data is updated for authenticators. For Classic Engine, see [Multifactor (MFA) Enrollment Policy](#multifactor-mfa-enrollment-policy).
> The authenticator enrollment policy is a <ApiLifecycle access="beta" /> release.

The authenticator enrollment policy controls which authenticators are available for a User, as well as when a User may enroll in a particular authenticator.

#### Authenticator enrollment policy settings example

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

> **Note:** Policy settings are included only for those authenticators that are enabled.

> **Note:** The `authenticators` parameter allows you to configure all available authenticators, including authentication and recovery. In contrast, the `factors` parameter only allows you to configure multifactor authentication.

> **Note:** For orgs with the Authenticator enrollment policy feature enabled, the new default authenticator enrollment policy created by Okta contains the `authenticators` property in the policy settings. Existing default authenticator enrollment policies from a migrated Classic Engine org remain unchanged and still use the `factors` property in their policy settings.

## Multifactor (MFA) Enrollment Policy

> **Note:** In Identity Engine, the Multifactor (MFA) Enrollment Policy name has changed to [authenticator enrollment policy](#authenticator-enrollment-policy). In Classic Engine, the Multifactor Enrollment Policy type remains unchanged and is a <ApiLifecycle access="beta" /> release.

The Multifactor (MFA) Enrollment Policy controls which MFA methods are available for a User, as well as when a User may enroll in a particular Factor.

## Password Policy

The Password Policy determines the requirements for a user's password length and complexity, as well as the frequency with which a password must be changed. This Policy also governs the recovery operations that may be performed by the User, including change password, reset (forgot) password, and self-service password unlock.

> **Note:** Password Policies are enforced only for Okta and AD-sourced users. For AD-sourced users, ensure that your Active Directory Policies don't conflict with the Okta Policies.

#### Recovery object

The Password Policy object contains the factors used for password recovery and account unlock.
However, if you are using the Identity Engine, it is recommended to set recovery factors in the Password Policy Rule as shown in the examples under [Password Rules Action Data](#password-actions-example).

### Policy conditions

The following conditions may be applied to Password Policy:

* [People Condition](#people-condition-object)

* [Authentication Provider Condition](#authentication-provider-condition-object)

### Password Rules Action data

#### Password Actions example

```json
  "actions": {
    "passwordChange": {
     "access": "ALLOW"
    },
    "selfServicePasswordReset": {
     "access": "ALLOW"
    },
    "selfServiceUnlock": {
     "access": "ALLOW"
    }
  },
```

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

With the Identity Engine, Recovery Factors can be specified inside the Password Policy Rule object instead of in the Policy Settings object. Recovery Factors for the rule are defined inside the `selfServicePasswordReset` Action.

The following three examples demonstrate how Recovery Factors are configured in the Rule based on admin requirements.

In this example, the requirement is that end users verify with just one Authenticator before they can recover their password. Email, SMS, Voice, or Okta Verify Push can be used by end users to initiate recovery. We know that only one Authenticator is required because there are no step up Authenticators specified as can be seen by the `stepUp` object having the `required` attribute set as `false`.

```json
"actions": {
      "passwordChange": {
        "access": "ALLOW"
      },
      "selfServicePasswordReset": {
        "access": "ALLOW",
        "requirement": {
          "primary": {
            "methods": [
              "EMAIL",
              "SMS",
              "VOICE",
              "PUSH"
            ]
          },
          "stepUp": {
            "required": false
          }
        }
      },
      "selfServiceUnlock": {
        "access": "ALLOW"
      }
}
```

In this example, the requirement is that end users verify two Authenticators before they can recover their password. Only email or Okta Verify Push can be used by end users to initiate recovery. A security question is required as a step up.


```json
"actions": {
      "passwordChange": {
        "access": "ALLOW"
      },
      "selfServicePasswordReset": {
        "access": "ALLOW",
        "requirement": {
          "primary": {
            "methods": [
              "EMAIL",
              "PUSH"
            ]
          },
          "stepUp": {
            "required": true,
            "methods": [
              "SECURITY_QUESTION"
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      "selfServiceUnlock": {
        "access": "ALLOW"
      }
}
```

In the final example, end users are required to verify two Authenticators before they can recover their password. Only Okta Verify Push can be used by end users to initiate recovery. A step-up verification is required for which they can use any enrolled Authenticator that can be used for sign-on. This is indicated by the `stepUp` object that contains only the `required` attribute set as `true` but without the `methods` array attribute.


```json
"actions": {
      "passwordChange": {
        "access": "ALLOW"
      },
      "selfServicePasswordReset": {
        "access": "ALLOW",
        "requirement": {
          "primary": {
            "methods": [
              "PUSH"
            ]
          },
          "stepUp": {
            "required": true
          }
        }
      },
      "selfServiceUnlock": {
        "access": "ALLOW"
      }
}
```

### Rules conditions

The following conditions may be applied to the Rules associated with Password Policy:

* [People Condition](#people-condition-object)

* [Network Condition](#network-condition-object)

## IdP Discovery Policy

The IdP Discovery Policy determines where to route Users when they are attempting to sign in to your org. Users can be routed to a variety of Identity Providers (`SAML2`, `IWA`, `AgentlessDSSO`, `X509`, `FACEBOOK`, `GOOGLE`, `LINKEDIN`, `MICROSOFT`, `OIDC`) based on multiple conditions. For more information, see [IdP Discovery](/docs/concepts/identity-providers/#idp-discovery).

All Okta orgs contain only one IdP Discovery Policy with an immutable default Rule routing to your org's sign-in page.

### Policy conditions

You can apply the following conditions to the IdP Discovery Policy:

* [Network Condition](#network-condition-object)

* [Platform Condition](#platform-condition-object)

> **Note:** Ability to define multiple providers is a part of the Identity Engine.
> Please [contact support](mailto:dev-inquiries@okta.com) for further information.

> **Note:** IdP types of `OKTA`, `AgentlessDSSO`, and `IWA` don't require an `id`.

#### Policy Action example

```json
  "actions": {
    "idp": {
      "providers": [
        {
          "type": "SAML2",
          "id": "0oaoz0zUsohjfrWZ80g3"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

#### Policy Action with multiple IdP instances

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

> **Note:** This feature is only available as a part of the Identity Engine. [Contact support](mailto:dev-inquiries@okta.com) for further information.

You can define multiple IdP instances in a single Policy Action. This allows users to choose a Provider when they sign in.

##### Provider object

> **Note:** IdP types `OKTA`, `AgentlessDSSO`, and `IWA` don't require an `id`.

| Property                           | Description             | Data Type | Required |
| ---                                | ---                     | ---       | ---      |
| id                                 | Provider `id` in Okta   | String    | Yes      |
| type                               | Provider type. Possible values: `OKTA`, `AgentlessDSSO`, `IWA`, `X509`, `SAML2`, `OIDC`, `APPLE`, `FACEBOOK`, `GOOGLE`, `LINKEDIN`, `MICROSOFT`           | String | Yes |
| name <ApiLifecycle access="ie" />  | Provider `name` in Okta | String    | No       |

#### Policy Action with Dynamic IdP routing
<ApiLifecycle access="ea"/>

> **Note:** Dynamic IdP Routing is an [Early Access](/docs/reference/releases-at-okta/#early-access-ea) (Self-Service) feature. You can enable the feature for your org from the **Settings** > **Features** page in the Admin Console.

You can choose to define an IdP instance in the Policy action or provide an [Okta Expression Language](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language-in-identity-engine/) with the [Login Context](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language-in-identity-engine/#login-context) that is evaluated with the IdP. For example, the value `login.identifier`
refers to the user's `username`. If the user is signing in with the username `john.doe@mycompany.com`, the expression, `login.identifier.substringAfter('@))` is evaluated to the domain name of the user, for example, `mycompany.com`. The IdP property that the evaluated string should match to is specified as the `propertyName`.

#### Dynamic IdP example

```json
  "idp": {
  "matchCriteria": [
      {
        "providerExpression": "login.identifier.substringAfter('@')",
        "propertyName": "name"
      }
    ],
  "providers": [],
  "idpSelectionType": "DYNAMIC"
}
```
##### IdP object

| Property                           | Description                              | Data Type | Required |
| ---                                | ---                                      | ---       | ---      |
| providerExpression                 | The expression that is evaluated          | Okta Expression Language    | Yes, if `idpSelectionType` is set to `DYNAMIC`      |
| propertyName                       | The property of the IdP that the evaluated `providerExpression` should match. The default value is `name`, which refers to the name of the IdP.| String | No |
| idpSelectionType | Determines whether the rule should use expression language or a specific IdP. Supported values: `SPECIFIC`,`DYNAMIC` | String    | Yes       |

##### Limitations

* You can add up to 10 providers to a single `idp` Policy Action.

* You can define only one `provider` for the following IdP types: `AgentlessDSSO`, `IWA`, `X509`.
* You can't define a provider if `idpSelectionType` is `DYNAMIC`.
* You can't define a `providerExpression` if `idpSelectionType` is `SPECIFIC`.
* If a [User Identifier Condition](#user-identifier-condition-object) is defined together with an `OKTA` provider, sign-in requests are handled by Okta exclusively.

##### Example

```json
  "actions": {
    "idp": {
      "providers": [
        {
          "type": "OKTA"
        },
        {
          "type": "SAML2",
          "id": "0oaoz0zUsohjfrWZ80g3",
          "name": "Other IdP"
        },
        {
          "type": "OIDC",
          "id": "0oaFz3WUgotjUKank5z8",
          "name": "External Identity Provider"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

## Authentication policy

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

> **Note:** This feature is only available as a part of the Identity Engine. [Contact support](mailto:dev-inquiries@okta.com) for further information.

> **Note:** The app sign-on policy name has changed to authentication policy. The policy type of `ACCESS_POLICY` remains unchanged.

An authentication policy determines the extra levels of authentication (if any) that must be performed before you can invoke a specific Okta application. This policy is always associated with an app through a mapping. Identity Engine always evaluates both the global session policy and the authentication policy for the app. The resulting user experience is the union of both policies. Authentication policies have a policy type of `ACCESS_POLICY`.

When you create a new application, the shared default authentication policy is associated with it. You can [create a different authentication policy for the app](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-auth-policy) or [add additional rules to the default authentication policy](/docs/guides/configure-signon-policy/#select-the-policy-and-add-a-rule) to meet your needs. Remember that any rules that you add to the shared authentication policy are automatically assigned to any new application that you create in your org. Additionally, you can [merge duplicate authentication policies with identical rules](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-merge-auth-policies) to improve policy management.

> **Note:** You can have a maximum of 5000 authentication policies in an org.
> There is a max limit of 100 rules allowed per policy.
> When you create an authentication policy, you automatically also create a default policy rule with the lowest priority of `99`.
> The highest priority that an authentication policy rule can be set to is `0`.

> **Note:** When you [merge duplicate authentication policies](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-merge-auth-policies), policy and mapping CRUD operations may be unavailable during the consolidation. When the consolidation is complete, you receive an email.

#### Authentication policy example

```json
    {
        "type": "ACCESS_POLICY",
        "name": "Web Cart App Sign On Policy",
        "description": "Standard policy for Web Cart application"
    }
```

Additionally, there is no direct property to get the policy ID for an application. Instead, you need to retrieve the application object and use the reference to the policy ID that is a part of the application object.

#### Authentication policy reference in HAL link in Application API Object example

```json
    {
        "accessPolicy": {
          "href": "https://demo.okta.com/api/v1/policies/rstn2baH9AACavHBO0g4"
        }
    }
```

### Policy conditions

Policy conditions aren't supported. Conditions are applied at the rule level for these types of policies.

### Policy Rules conditions

You can apply the following conditions to the rules associated with an authentication policy:

* [People Condition](#people-condition-object)

* [Network Condition](#network-condition-object)

* [Device Condition](#device-condition-object)

* [Platform Condition](#platform-condition-object)

* [Okta Expression Language Condition](#okta-expression-language-condition-object)

| `access`                  | `ALLOW` or      | `ALLOW` or `DENY`                               | Yes                           | N/A     |
| `verificationMethod`      | Describes the method to verify the user. The only supported method type is `ASSURANCE`.    | [Verification Method Object](#verification-method-object)  | Yes  | [Default](#app-sign-on-action-default-example)        |

### Verification Method object

The Verification Method ensures that a user is verified. The only supported type is `ASSURANCE`.

Assurance is the degree of confidence that the end user signing in to an application or service is the same end user who previously enrolled or signed in to the application or service.

Authenticators can be broadly classified into three kinds of Factors. A Factor represents the mechanism by which an end user owns or controls the Authenticator. The three classifications are:

* Knowledge: something you know, such as a password
* Possession: something you have, such as a phone
* Inherence: something you are, such as a fingerprint or other biometric scan

Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is the use of more than one Factor. MFA is the most common way to increase assurance. Authenticators also have other characteristics that may raise or lower assurance. For example, possession Factors may be implemented in software or hardware, with hardware being able to provide greater protection when storing shared secrets or private keys, and thus providing higher assurance.

| Property            | Data Type              | Description                                                                                                             | Supported Values                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `factorMode`         | String            | The number of factors required to satisfy this assurance level                                                         | `1FA`, `2FA`                                                                                      |
| `type`         | String            | The Verification Method type                                                         | `ASSURANCE`     |
| `constraints`        | Array of [Constraint Object](#constraints)           | A JSON array that contains nested Authenticator Constraint objects that are organized by the Authenticator class        | [Constraint Object](#constraints) that consists of a `POSSESSION` constraint, a `KNOWLEDGE` constraint, or both. See [Verification Method JSON Examples](#verification-method-json-examples).  |
| `reauthenticateIn`   | String (ISO 8601) | The duration after which the user must re-authenticate, regardless of user activity. Keep in mind that the re-authentication intervals for `constraints` (see [Constraint object](#constraints)) take precedent over this value. | ISO 8601 period format for recurring time intervals (for example: `PT2H`, `PT0S`, `PT43800H`, and so on)  |
| `inactivityPeriod`   | String (ISO 8601) | The inactivity duration after which the user must re-authenticate  | ISO 8601 period format (for example: `PT2H`)  |

#### Constraints

The Constraints are logically evaluated such that only one Constraint object needs to be satisfied, but within a Constraint object, each Constraint property must be satisfied.

##### Constraints default example

```json
"constraints": [
  { // object 1
    "knowledge": {  // 1A
      "types": [
        "password"
      ],
      "reauthenticateIn": "PTOS"
    },
    "possession": { // 1B
      "userPresence": "OPTIONAL"
    }
  },
  { // object 2
    "knowledge": {  // 2A
      "types": [
        "password"
      ],
    },
    "possession": { // 2B
      "phishingResistant": "REQUIRED"
    }
  }
]
```

In the preceding example, the Assurance policy is satisfied if Constraint object 1 (password factor with re-authentication on every sign-in attempt and a possession factor) or Constraint object 2 (password factor and a possession factor that is a phishing-resistant, such as WebAuthn ) is satisfied.

This can be read logically as: `( (1A && 1B) || (2A && 2B) )`

The number of Authenticator class constraints in each Constraint object must be less than or equal to the value of `factorMode`. If the value of `factorMode` is less, there are no constraints on any additional Factors.

## Profile Enrollment policy

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

Profile Enrollment policies specify which profile attributes are required for creating new Users through self-service registration and also can be used for progressive profiling. The type is specified as `PROFILE_ENROLLMENT`.

When you create a new profile enrollment policy, a policy rule is created by default. This type of policy can only have one policy rule, so it's not possible to create other rules. Instead, consider editing the default one to meet your needs.

> **Note:** You can't update or delete the required base attributes in the default user profile: `email`, `firstName`, or `lastName`.

> **Note:** You can have a maximum of 500 profile enrollment policies in an org.
> A Profile Enrollment policy can only have one rule associated with it. Adding more rules isn't allowed.


#### Profile Enrollment Policy example

```json
    {
        "type": "PROFILE_ENROLLMENT",
        "name": "User Profile Policy",
        "description": "Standard policy for profile enrollment"
    }
```

### Policy conditions
