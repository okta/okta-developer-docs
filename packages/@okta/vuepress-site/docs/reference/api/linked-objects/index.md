# Linked Objects API

The Okta Linked Objects API provides operations to manage Okta relationships between Users.

Explore the [Okta Public API Collections](https://www.postman.com/okta-eng/workspace/okta-public-api-collections/overview) workspace to get started with the Linked Objects API.

<!--Explore the Linked Objects API and User Linked Objects API: [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/e2c0074faecec203e487)


Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship.

1. Create a Linked Object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You create a Linked Object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

For each relationship:

* A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager), but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
* A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
* A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

For details, see the [Linked Object object](#linked-object-object).

Okta Expression Language function for [Linked Objects](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

> **Note:** The Linked Objects feature isn't available for OpenID Connect claims.

## Example usage

Okta allows you to create up to 200 Linked Object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

* A manager has many subordinates. Each subordinate has one manager.
* A sales representative has many customers. Each customer has one sales rep.
* A case worker has many clients. Each client has one case worker.

Most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the Linked Object definition once, and then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per Linked Object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one Linked Object definition.

For example, assume that you've created one Linked Object definition for manager (`primary`) and for subordinates (`associated`):

* Joe is Frank's manager.
* Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
* Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

Thus, you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank) or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

Then, if you create another Linked Object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

* Bob is the scrum lead for the Identity Scrum team.
* Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same Linked Object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrumlead:Contributor Linked Object definition.

To represent a relationship, create a Linked Object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child) relationship, and then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

## Links between User Types

If you created multiple User Types (see [User Types](/docs/reference/api/user-types)), they all share the same Linked Object definitions. For example, if you have separate User Types for employees and contractors, a link could designate an employee as the manager for a contractor, with the contractor being a subordinate of that employee.

## Link definition operations

<!--<ApiAuthMethodWarning />-->

Link definition operations allow you to manage the creation and removal of the link definitions. If you remove a link definition, links based on that definition are unavailable. These operations are available at the new [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/) as part of the [Linked Objects API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LinkedObject/).

<!--
> **Note:** Links reappear if you recreate the definition. However, Okta is likely to change this behavior so that links don't reappear. Don't rely on this behavior in production environments.

Each org can create up to 200 definitions and assign them to an unlimited number of users.
-->
### Add Linked Object definition to User Profile schema

See [Create a Linked Object Definition](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LinkedObject/#tag/LinkedObject/operation/createLinkedObjectDefinition) in the new [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/).

<!--
<ApiOperation method="post" url="/api/v1/meta/schemas/user/linkedObjects" />

Adds a Linked Object definition to the User Profile schema. The `name` field found in both the `primary` and `associated` objects can't start with a number and can only contain the following characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `_`.

##### Request parameters


| Parameter        | Description                | DataType       | Required      |
| :--------------- | :-----------------         | :------------- | :------------ |

```

### Deprecated operations

An earlier version of this API included the element `/default/linkedObjects` rather than just `/linkedObjects` in all of the URLs for operations on Linked Object definitions. These earlier endpoints are still supported but are deprecated. As described under [Links between User Types](#links-between-user-types), all Linked Object definitions apply to all User Types, not just to the default type. That is true for the deprecated operations as well. They affect all User Types, just like the corresponding endpoints that omit `/default`.
-->

## Link value operations

Use link value operations to assign users to a relationship (a pair of `primary` and `associated` links). These operations are available at the new [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/) as part of the [User Linked Objects API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLinkedObject/).

<!--
For the following operations, the examples use consistent IDs so that you can follow the operations more easily:

* `manager` is the `primary` relationship and is assigned to `00u5t60iloOHN9pBi0h7`
* `subordinate` is the `associated` relationship and is assigned to `00u5zex6ztMbOZhF50h7`
-->

### Set Linked Object value for primary

See [Assign a Linked Object value for primary](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLinkedObject/#tag/UserLinkedObject/operation/assignLinkedObjectValueForPrimary) in the new [Okta API reference portal](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/).

<!--
<ApiOperation method="put" url="/api/v1/users/${associated.userId}/linkedObjects/${primary.name}/${primary.userId}" />

Sets the first user as the `associated` and the second user as the `primary` for the specified relationship. If the first user is already associated with a different `primary` for this relationship, the previous link is removed. A Linked Object relationship can specify only one primary user for an associated user.
