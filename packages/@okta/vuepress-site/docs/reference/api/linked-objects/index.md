# Linked Objects API

Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship:

1. Create a linked object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You'll create a linked object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

For each relationship:

* A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager) but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
* A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
* A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

For details, see the [Linked Object object](#linked-object-object).

The Expression Language function for [Linked Objects](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

>**Note:** Linked Objects feature is not available for OpenID Connect claims.

## Example Usage

Okta allows you to create up to 200 linked object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

* A manager has many subordinates; each subordinate has one manager
* A sales representative has many customers; each customer has one sales rep
* A case worker has many clients; each client has one case worker

Of course, most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the linked object definition once, then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per linked object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one linked object definition.

For example, assume that you've created one linked object definition for manager (`primary`) and subordinates (`associated`):

* Joe is Frank's manager.
* Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
* Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

Thus you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank), or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

Then, if you created another linked object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

* Bob is the scrum master for the Identity Scrum Team
* Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same linked object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrummaster:Contributor linked object definition.

To represent a relationship, create a linked object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child), then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

## Links Between User Types

If you have created multiple User Types (see [User Types](/docs/reference/api/user-types)), they all share the same linked object definitions. For example, if you have separate User Types for Employees and Contractors, a link could designate an Employee as the Manager for a Contractor, with the Contractor being a Subordinate of that Employee.

## Getting Started

Explore the Linked Objects API: [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/09416941ad62f022cabb)

## Link Definition Operations

Link definition operations allow you to manage the creation and removal of the link definitions. If you remove a link definition, links based on that definition are unavailable.

> Currently, links reappear if you recreate the definition. However, Okta is likely to change this behavior so that links don't reappear. Don't rely on this behavior in production environments.

Each org can create up to 200 definitions, and assign them to an unlimited number of users.

### Add Linked Object Definition to User Profile Schema


<ApiOperation method="post" url="/api/v1/meta/schemas/user/linkedObjects" />

### Deprecated Operations

An earlier version of this API included the element `/default/linkedObjects` instead of just `/linkedObjects` in all the URLs for operations on Linked Object definitions. These earlier endpoints are still supported but are deprecated. As described under [Links Between User Types](#links-between-user-types), all Linked Object definitions apply to all User Types, not just to the default type. That is true for the deprecated operations as well; they affect all User Types, just like the corresponding endpoints that omit `/default`.

## Link Value Operations

Use link value operations to assign users to a relationship (pair of `primary` and `associated` links).

For the following operations, the examples use consistent IDs so you can follow the operations more easily:

* `manager` is the `primary` relationship, and is assigned to `00u5t60iloOHN9pBi0h7`
* `subordinate` is the `associated` relationship, and is assigned to `00u5zex6ztMbOZhF50h7`

### Set Linked Object Value for Primary


<ApiOperation method="put" url="/api/v1/users/${associated.userId}/linkedObjects/${primary.name}/${primary.userId}" />

Sets the first user as the `associated` and the second user as the `primary` for the specified relationship. If the first user is already associated with a different `primary` for this relationship, the previous link is removed. A linked object relationship can specify only one primary user for an associated user.

##### Request Parameters

| associated.userId | User ID or `login` value of user to be assigned the `associated` relationship                | String            | TRUE          |

| primary.userId    | User ID to be assigned to `primary` for the `associated` user in the specified relationship. | String            | TRUE          |

##### Response Parameters


None

##### Request Example


```bash
curl -v -X PUT \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
