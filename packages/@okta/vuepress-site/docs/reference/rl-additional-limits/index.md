# Additional rate limits

This page provides Okta's additional limits on:

* [Concurrent requests](#concurrent-rate-limits)
* [End-user rate limit](#end-user-rate-limits)
* [Home page endpoints](#home-page-endpoints-and-per-minute-limits)
* [Okta-generated email messages](#okta-generated-email-message-rate-limits)
* [Per-user limits](#per-user-limits)
* [Workforce license rate limit multiplier](#workforce-license-rate-limit-multiplier)

These limits are part of the Okta [Rate limit](/docs/reference/rate-limits) policy.

> **Note:**
>
> * In addition to the rate limits listed on this page, Okta applies rate limits per API, divided into three categories. See the [Rate limit overview](/docs/reference/rate-limits).
> * To learn more about how to manage rate limits, see our [best practices](/docs/reference/rl-best-practices).
> * You can expand Okta rate limits upon request. To learn how, see [Request exceptions](/docs/reference/rl-best-practices/#request-exceptions) and [DynamicScale rate limits](/docs/reference/rl-dynamic-scale/).

## Concurrent rate limits

To protect the service for all customers, Okta enforces concurrent rate limits, which is a limit on the number of simultaneous transactions. Concurrent rate limits are distinct from [the org-wide, per-minute API rate limits](/docs/reference/rate-limits/), which measure the total number of transactions per minute. Transactions are typically very short-lived. Even very large bulk loads rarely use more than 10 simultaneous transactions at a time.

For concurrent rate limits, traffic is measured in three different areas. Counts in one area aren't included in counts for the other two:

* For agent traffic, Okta has set the limit based on typical org use. This limit varies from agent to agent.
* For Office365 traffic, the limit is 75 concurrent transactions per org.
* For all other traffic, including API requests, the limit is described in the table below.

| Developer (free)  | Developer (paid)  | One App  | Enterprise  | Workforce Identity  |
| ----------------: | ----------------: | -------: | ----------: | ------------------: |
| 15                | 35                | 35       | 75          | 75                  |

The first request to exceed the concurrent limit returns an HTTP 429 error, and the first error every 60 seconds is written to the log. Reporting concurrent rate limits once a minute keeps log volume manageable.

> **Note:** Under normal circumstances, customers don't exceed the concurrency limits. Exceeding them may be an indication of a problem that requires investigation.

These rate limits apply to all new Okta organizations. For orgs created before 2018-05-17, the [previous rate limits](/docs/reference/rl-previous/) still apply.

> **Note:** For information on possible interaction between Inline Hooks and concurrent rate limits, see [Inline hooks and concurrent rate limits](/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/#inline-hooks-and-concurrent-rate-limits).

### End-user rate limits

Okta limits the number of requests from the Admin Console and End-User Dashboard to 40 requests per user per 10 seconds per endpoint. This rate limit protects users from each other and from other API requests in the system.

If a user exceeds this limit, they receive an HTTP 429 error response without affecting other users in your org. A message is written to the System Log that indicates that the end-user rate limit was encountered.

### Home page endpoints and per-minute limits

The following endpoints are used by the Okta home page for authentication and user sign in and have org-wide rate limits:

| Okta home page endpoints                                                | Developer (free)  | Developer (paid)  | One App  | Enterprise  | Workforce Identity |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------: | ----------------: | -------: | ----------: | ------------------:|
| `/app/{app}/{key}/sso/saml`                                             | 100               | 300               | *300     | *600        | 750                |
| `/app/office365/{key}/sso/wsfed/active`                                 | N/A               | N/A               | N/A      | 2000        | 1000               |
| `/app/office365/{key}/sso/wsfed/passive`                                | N/A               | N/A               | N/A      | 250         | 250                |
| `/app/template_saml_2_0/{key}/sso/saml`                                 | 100               | 300               | *300     | *600        | 2500               |
| `/login/do-login`                                                       | 100               | 300               | 300      | 600         | 200                |
| `/login/login.htm`                                                      | 100               | 300               | 300      | 600         | 850                |
| `/login/sso_iwa_auth`                                                   | 100               | 300               | 300      | 600         | 500                |
| `/api/plugin/{protocolVersion}/form-cred/{appUserIds}/{formSiteOption}` | 100               | 300               | *300     | *600        | 650                |
| `/api/plugin/{protocolVersion}/sites`                                   | 20                | 50                | 50       | 100         | 150                |
| `/bc/image/fileStoreRecord`                                             | 100               | 300               | *300     | *600        | 500                |
| `/bc/globalFileStoreRecord`                                             | 100               | 300               | *300     | *600        | 500                |

These rate limits apply to all new Okta organizations. For orgs created before 2018-05-17, the [previous rate limits](/docs/reference/rl-previous/) still apply.

The limits for these endpoints can be increased by purchasing the [High-capacity add-on](/docs/reference/rl-previous/#high-capacity-rate-limits).

### Okta-generated email message rate limits

Limits are applied on a per-recipient basis and vary by email type. The limit for some email types is no more than 30 emails per-recipient, per-minute, while other email types are configured with higher limits. These limits protect your org against denial-of-service attacks and help ensure that adequate resources are available for all customers.

### Per-user limits

API endpoints that take username and password credentials, including the [Authentication API](/docs/reference/api/authn/) and the [OAuth 2.0 resource owner password flow](/docs/guides/implement-password/), have a per-username rate limit to prevent brute force attacks with the user's password:

| Action and Okta API endpoint                                      | Per User limits (all orgs) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------: |
| **Authenticate the same user:**<br>`/api/v1/authn`                | 4 per second               |
| **Generate or refresh an OAuth 2.0 token:**<br>`/oauth2/v1/token` | 4 per second               |

### Workforce license rate limit multiplier

Workforce orgs that are created after December 17, 2020 have increased default rate limits. This increase is for [specific endpoints](#list-of-endpoints) and depends on a Workforce org's license count (Universal Directory or Single-Sign On).


| Workforce licenses | Rate limit multiplier      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------: |
| < 10K              | 1x the default rate limit  |
| 10K - 100K         | 5x the default rate limit  |
| > 100K             | 10x the default rate limit |
