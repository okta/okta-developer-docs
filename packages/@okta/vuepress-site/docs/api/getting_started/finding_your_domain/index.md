# Finding Your Okta Domain

If you're building an application using one of our SDKs or client libraries, you may run into the following message:

> Your Okta URL is missing. Replace `{yourOktaDomain}` with your Okta domain. You can copy your domain from the Okta Developer Console.

To find your Okta URL (also called an Okta domain), use the following steps:

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.
2. Look for the Okta domain in the top right corner of the dashboard:

![Okta domain in the top right corner of the dashboard](/assets/img/okta-domain.png "Okta domain in the top right corner of the dashboard")

Your Okta domain will look like:

* `example.oktapreview.com`
* `example.okta.com`
* `example.okta-emea.com`
* Or, a custom domain like `id.example.com` if you have configured a [Custom URL Domain](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Settings/custom-url-domain.htm?cshid=ext_custom_url_domain)

If your dashboard looks different, try choosing the Developer Console view from the top left menu. If you're stuck and need help, post a question on our [Developer Forum](https://devforum.okta.com).
