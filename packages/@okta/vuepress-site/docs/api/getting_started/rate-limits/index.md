# Rate Limits at Okta

The number of API requests for an organization is limited for all APIs in order to protect the service for all users. The number of Okta-generated emails that can be sent also has rate limits.

Okta has two types of API rate limits:

* [Org-wide rate limits](#org-wide-rate-limits) that vary by API endpoint. These limits are applied on a per-minute or per-second basis, and some are also applied on a per-user basis. For example, if your org sends a request to list applications more than one hundred times in a minute, the org-wide rate limit is exceeded. These limits protect against denial-of-service attacks, and help ensure that adequate resources are available for all customers.
* [Concurrent rate limits](#concurrent-rate-limits) on the number of simultaneous transactions. For example, if you sent 77 very long-lasting requests to any API endpoint simultaneously, you might exceed the concurrent rate limit.

Okta has one type of email rate limit:

* [Okta-Generated Email Message Rate Limits](#okta-generated-email-message-rate-limits) that vary by email type. Okta enforces rate limits on the number of Okta-generated email messages that are sent to customers and customer users. For example, if the number of emails sent to a given user exceeds the per-minute limit for a given email type, subsequent emails of that type are dropped for that user until that minute elapses.

Rate limits may be changed to protect customers. We provide advance warning of changes when possible.

## Org-Wide Rate Limits

API rate limits apply per minute or per second to the endpoints in an org.

If an org-wide rate limit is exceeded, an HTTP 429 status code is returned.
You can anticipate hitting the rate limit by checking [Okta's rate limiting headers](#check-your-rate-limits-with-oktas-rate-limit-headers).

Rate limits differ depending on the level of service you have purchased from Okta. See the [pricing page](https://developer.okta.com/pricing/) for more details.

High capacity rate limits apply to a variety of endpoints across different APIs for customers that purchased this add-on. These rate limits can be found [below](#high-capacity-rate-limits).

> If you have a One App or Enterprise organization, the admin console will display a banner and you will receive an email notification when your org approaches its rate limit.

### Okta API Endpoints and Per Minute Limits

Note that limits for more specific endpoints override the limits for less specific endpoints. For example, the limit for getting an application by ID is higher than the more general limit for the `/api/v1/apps` endpoint.

These rate limits apply to all new Okta organizations. For orgs created before 2018-05-17, the [previous rate limits](#previous-rate-limits) still apply.

* The limits for these endpoints can be increased by purchasing the [High-Capacity add-on](#high-capacity-rate-limits).

### Okta API Endpoints and Per-User Limits
API endpoints that take username and password credentials, including the [Authentication API](/docs/api/resources/authn) and the [OAuth 2.0 resource owner password flow](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/password), have a per-username rate limit to prevent brute force attacks with the user's password:

| Action and Okta API Endpoint                                      | Per User Limits (All Orgs) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------: |
| **Authenticate the same user:**<br>`/api/v1/authn`                | 4 per second               |
| **Generate or refresh an OAuth 2.0 token:**<br>`/oauth2/v1/token` | 4 per second               |

### Okta Rate Limits for All Other Endpoints

Finally, for all endpoints not listed in the tables above, the API rate limit is a combined rate limit:

| Developer (free) | Developer (paid) | One App    | Enterprise | Workforce Identity |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| 1000             | 3000             | 3000       | 6000       | 10000              |

For organizations created before 2018-05-17, the limit is 10,000 requests per minute.

### Okta Home Page Endpoints and Per-Minute Limits

The following endpoints are used by the Okta home page for authentication and sign on, and have org-wide rate limits:

| Okta Home Page Endpoints                                                | Developer (free) | Developer (paid) | One App | Enterprise | Workforce Identity |

These rate limits apply to all new Okta organizations. For orgs created before 2018-05-17, the [previous rate limits](#previous-rate-limits) still apply.

*The limits for these endpoints can be increased by purchasing the [High-Capacity add-on](#high-capacity-rate-limits).

### High Capacity Rate Limits

If your needs exceed Okta's rate limits, you can purchase the "High Capacity Rate Limit" add-on. Customers who purchase the "High Capacity Rate Limit" add-on service may not use the service in excess of the "static" rate limit, as set forth in the table below.  If Okta makes any change to the rate limit, such change will be communicated to customers via an updated version of this product documentation.

The following are the high capacity rate limits per minute that apply across the Okta API for these endpoints:

| Endpoint                                                                   | One App   | Enterprise   |

If your usage needs exceed the rate limits applicable to the "High Capacity Rate Limit" add-on service, please contact your Okta Sales Representative regarding other options.

### End-User Rate Limit

Okta limits the number of requests from the administrator and end-user UI to 40 requests per user per 10 seconds per endpoint. This rate limit protects users from each other, and from other API requests in the system.

If a user exceeds this limit, they receive an HTTP 429 response without affecting other users in your org.
A message is written to the System Log indicating that the end-user rate limit was encountered.

## Concurrent Rate Limits

In order to protect the service for all customers, Okta enforces concurrent rate limits, a limit on the number of simultaneous transactions. Concurrent rate limits are distinct from [the org-wide, per-minute API rate limits](#org-wide-rate-limits), which measure the total number of transactions per minute. Transactions are typically very short-lived. Even very large bulk loads rarely use more than 10 simultaneous transactions at a time.

For concurrent rate limits, traffic is measured in three different areas. Counts in one area aren't included in counts for the other two:

* For agent traffic, Okta has set the limit based on typical org usage. This limit varies from agent to agent.
* For Office365 traffic, the limit is 75 concurrent transactions per org.
* For all other traffic, including API requests, the limit is described in the table below.

| Developer (free) | Developer (paid) | One App | Enterprise | Workforce Identity |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| 15               | 35               | 35      | 75         | 75                 |

The first request to exceed the concurrent limit returns an HTTP 429 error, and the first error every sixty seconds is written to the log. Reporting concurrent rate limits once a minute keeps log volume manageable.

> Under normal circumstances, customers don't exceed the concurrency limits. Exceeding them may be an indication of a problem which requires investigation.

These rate limits apply to all new Okta organizations. For orgs created before 2018-05-17, the [previous rate limits](#previous-rate-limits) still apply.

## Check Your Rate Limits with Okta's Rate Limit Headers

Okta provides three headers in each response to report on both concurrent and org-wide rate limits.

For org-wide rate limits, the three headers show the limit that is being enforced, when it resets, and how close you are to hitting the limit:
* `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - the rate limit ceiling that is applicable for the current request.
* `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - the number of requests left for the current rate-limit window.
* `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - the time at which the rate limit will reset, specified in UTC epoch time.

For example:

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 10000
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 9999
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1516307596
```

The best way to be sure about org-wide rate limits is to check the relevant headers in the response. The System Log doesn't report every
API request. Rather, it typically reports completed or attempted real-world events such as configuration changes, user logins, or user lockouts.
The System Log doesn't report the rate at which you've been calling the API.

Instead of the accumulated counts for time-based rate limits, when a request exceeds the limit for concurrent requests,
`X-Rate-Limit-Limit`, `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining`, and `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` report the concurrent values.

The three headers behave a little differently for concurrent rate limits: when the number of unfinished requests is below the concurrent rate limit, request headers only report org-wide rate limits.
When you exceed a concurrent rate limit threshold, the headers report that the limit has been exceeded. When you drop back down below the concurrent rate limit, the headers  switch back to reporting the time-based rate limits.
Additionally, the `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` time for concurrent rate limits is only a suggestion. There's no guarantee that enough requests will complete to stop exceeding the concurrent rate limit at the time indicated.

### Example Rate Limit Header with Org-Wide Rate Limit

This example shows the relevant portion of a rate limit header being returned with  for a request that hasn't exceeded the org-wide rate limit for the `/api/v1/users` endpoint:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200
Date: Tue, 27 Jan 2018 21:33:25 GMT
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 600
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 598
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1516308901
```

The following example show a rate limit header being returned for a request that has exceeded the rate limit for the `/api/v1/users` endpoint:

```http
HTTP/1.1 429
Date: Tue, 27 Jan 2018 21:33:25 GMT
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 600
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 0
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1516308966
```

### Example Rate Limit Header with Concurrent Rate Limit

This example shows the relevant portion of a rate limit header being returned with the error for a request that exceeded the concurrent rate limit. If the rate limit wasn't being exceeded, the headers would contain information about the org-wide rate limit. You won't ever see non-error concurrent rate limits in the headers.

```http
HTTP/1.1 429
Date: Tue, 26 Jan 2018 21:33:25 GMT
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 0
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 0
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1506461721
```

The first two header values are always `0` for concurrent rate limit errors.
The third header reports an estimated time interval when the concurrent rate limit may be resolved. It is not a guarantee.

The error condition resolves itself as soon as there is another concurrent thread available. Normally, no intervention is required. However, if you notice frequent bursts of 429 errors, or if the concurrent rate limit isn't quickly resolved, you may be exceeding the concurrent rate limit. If you can't identify what is causing you to exceed the limit by examining activity in the log before the burst of 429 errors are logged, contact [Support](https://support.okta.com/help/open_case).

## Requesting Exceptions

You can request a temporary rate limit increase. For example, if you are importing a large number of users and groups you may need a temporary rate limit increase.

To request an exception, contact [Support](https://support.okta.com/help/open_case) 10 days before you need the increase, and provide the following details:

* Your Org Name: the entire URL, for example `https://cloudcompany.okta.com` or `https://unicorn.oktapreview.com`
* Endpoints and rates: the URI that need to have their limits increased and how much of an increase is required
* Start date and time
* End date and time
* Business justification: why you need the temporary increase

If you have an application that requires sustained rate limits higher than the posted limits, please consult an Okta Sales Representative for more options.

## Previous Rate Limits

These are the rate limits for orgs created before 2018-05-17.

### Org-Wide Rate Limits (Legacy Orgs)

Extensions to the base URLs listed below are included in the specified limit, unless the URL is followed by "only." For example, `/api/v1/apps/{id}` has a per-minute rate limit of `500` as listed in the second line in the table. However, `/api/v1/apps/{id}/users` falls under the more general first line of the table. This pattern applies to all the URLs.

### Concurrent Rate Limits (Legacy Orgs)

For legacy orgs, the limit is 75 concurrent transactions.

### Home Page Endpoint Limits (Legacy Orgs)

The following endpoints are used by the Okta home page for authentication and sign on, and have org-wide rate limits:

| Okta Home Page Endpoints                                                | Per-Minute Limit |

## Okta-Generated Email Message Rate Limits

Limits are applied on a per-recipient basis and vary by email-type. The limit for some email types is no more than 30 emails per-recipient, per-minute, while other email types are configured with higher limits. These limits protect your org against denial-of-service attacks and help ensure that adequate resources are available for all customers.
