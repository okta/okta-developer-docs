# OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 API

Okta is a standards-compliant [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/documentation) authorization server and a certified [OpenID Connect Provider](http://openid.net/certification).

OpenID Connect extends OAuth 2.0. The OAuth 2.0 protocol provides API security via scoped access tokens, and OpenID Connect provides user authentication and single sign-on (SSO) functionality.

This page contains detailed information about the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect endpoints that Okta exposes on its authorization servers. For higher-level information about how to use these endpoints, see the [Okta Authentication Guide](/authentication-guide/).

## Endpoints

### Composing Your Base URL

All of the endpoints on this page start with an authorization server, however the URL for that server will vary depending on the endpoint and the type of authorization server. You have two types of authorization servers to choose from, depending on your use case:

#### 1. Single sign-on to Okta

This is for the use case where your users are all part of your Okta organization and you would just like to offer them single sign-on with an ID token. In this case Okta is your authorization server, which we refer to as the "Okta Org Authorization Server" and your full URL looks like this:

`https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/authorize`

#### 2. Okta as the identity platform for your app or API

This is for use cases where Okta is the identity and authorization platform for your application or API, so your users will be logging in to something other than Okta. In this case you are using a Custom Authorization Server inside Okta, and your full URL looks like this:

`https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/${authServerId}/v1/authorize`

If you have a developer account, you can use the `default` authorization server that was created along with your account, in which case the full URL looks like this:

`https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize`

### /authorize


<ApiOperation method="get" url="${baseUrl}/v1/authorize" />

> This endpoint's base URL varies depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. For more information, see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url).

This is a starting point for browser-based OpenID Connect flows such as the implicit and authorization code flows. This request
authenticates the user and returns tokens along with an authorization grant to the client application as a part
of the callback response.

> When making requests to the `/authorize` endpoint, the browser (user agent) should be redirected to the endpoint. You can't use AJAX with this endpoint.

Session tokens can be obtained via the [Authentication API](/docs/api/resources/authn/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Query       | String    | FALSE      |
| state                            | A value to be returned in the token. The client application can use it to remember the state of its interaction with the end user at the time of the authentication call. It can contain alphanumeric, comma, period, underscore and hyphen characters. See [Parameter Details](#parameter-details).                                                                                                                                               | Query       | String    | TRUE       |

#### Parameter Details

 * `idp`, `sessionToken` and `idp_scope` are Okta extensions to [the OpenID specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication).
    All other parameters comply with the OpenID Connect specification and their behavior is consistent with the specification.

* `prompt`:

    If no `prompt` parameter is specified, the standard behavior occurs:
    * If an Okta session already exists, the user is silently authenticated. Otherwise, the user is prompted to authenticate.
     * If scopes are requested that require consent and consent is not yet given by the authenticated user, the user is prompted to give consent.

    There are four possible values for this parameter:

    * `none`: Do not prompt for authentication or consent. If an Okta session already exists, the user is silently authenticated. Otherwise, an error is returned.
    * `login`: Always prompt the user for authentication, regardless of whether they have an Okta session.
    * `consent`: <ApiLifecycle access="ea" /> Depending on the [values set for `consent_method` in the app and and `consent` on the scope](/docs/api/resources/apps/#add-oauth-20-client-application), display the Okta consent dialog, even if the user has already given consent. User consent is available for Custom Authorization Servers (requires the API Access Management feature and the User Consent feature enabled).
    * `login consent` or `consent login` (order doesn't matter): The user is always prompted for authentication, and the user consent dialog is displayed depending on the [values set for `consent_method` in the app and and `consent` on the scope](/docs/api/resources/apps/#add-oauth-20-client-application), even if the user has already given consent.

`request`:

  * You must sign the JWT using either the app's client secret, or a private key whose public key is registered on the app's JWKSet.
  * The JWT can't be encrypted.
  * Okta supports the [HMAC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.2), [RSA](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.3) and [ECDSA](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.4) signature algorithms. HMAC signatures require that the client has a `token_endpoint_auth_method` which uses a `client_secret`. RSA and ECDSA signatures requires that the client registers a public key.
  * We recommend you don't duplicate any request parameters in both the JWT and the query URI itself. However, you can do so with `state`, `nonce`, `code_challenge`, and `code_challenge_method`. In those cases, the values in the JWT will override the query URI values.
  * Okta validates the `request` parameter in the following ways:
    1. `iss` is required and must  be the `client_id`.
    2. `aud` is required and must be same value as the authorization server issuer that mints the ID or access token. This value is published in the metadata for your authorization server.
    3. JWT lifetime is evaluated using the `iat` and `exp` claims if present. If the JWT is expired or not yet valid, Okta returns an `invalid_request_object`  error.
    4. Okta rejects the JWT if the `jti` claim is present and it has already been processed.

`response_mode`:

Each value for `response_mode` delivers different behavior:
* `fragment` - Parameters are encoded in the URL fragment added to the `redirect_uri` when redirecting back to the client.
* `query` - Parameters are encoded in the query string added to the `redirect_uri` when redirecting back to the client.
* `form_post` - Parameters are encoded as HTML form values (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format) and are transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the client.
* `okta_post_message` - Uses [HTML5 Web Messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) (for example, window.postMessage()) instead of the redirect for the authorization response from the `/authorize` endpoint.

    `okta_post_message` is an adaptation of the [Web Message Response Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sakimura-oauth-wmrm-00#section-4.1).
    This value provides a secure way for a single-page application to perform a sign-in flow
    in a popup window or an iFrame and receive the ID token and/or access token back in the parent page without leaving the context of that page.
    The data model for the postMessage call is in the next section.
* The `Referrer-Policy` header is automatically included in the request for `fragment` or `query`, and is set to `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

`state`:

Okta requires the OAuth 2.0 `state` parameter on all requests to the `/authorize` endpoint in order to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
 The OAuth 2.0 specification [requires](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12) that clients protect their redirect URIs against CSRF by sending a value in the authorize request which binds the request to the user-agent's authenticated state.
 Using the `state` parameter is also a countermeasure to several other known attacks as outlined in [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819).

#### postMessage() Data Model

Use the postMessage() data model to help you when working with the `okta_post_message` value of the `response_mode` request parameter.

`message`:

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                   | DataType |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| access_token        | An [access token](#access-token). This is returned if the `response_type` included `token`.   | String   |
| error               | The error code, if something went wrong.                                                      | String   |
| error_description   | Additional error information (if any).                                                        | String   |
| id_token            | An [ID token](#id-token). This is returned if the `response_type` included `id_token`.        | String   |
| state               | The unmodified `state` value from the request.                                                | String   |

`targetOrigin`:

Specifies what the origin of `parentWindow` must be in order for the postMessage() event to be dispatched
(this is enforced by the browser). The `okta-post-message` response mode always uses the origin from the `redirect_uri`
specified by the client. This is crucial to prevent the sensitive token data from being exposed to a malicious site.

#### Response Properties

Irrespective of the response type, the contents of the response are as described in the table.

| Property            | Description                                                                                                                                                                              | DataType |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| access_token        | An [access token](#access-token). This is returned if `response_type` included `token`.                                                                                                  | String   |
| code                | An opaque value that can be used to redeem tokens from the [token endpoint](#token). `code` is returned if the `response_type` includes `code`. The code has a lifetime of 60 seconds.   | String   |
| error               | The error code, if something went wrong.                                                                                                                                                 | String   |
| error_description   | Additional error information (if any).                                                                                                                                                   | String   |
| expires_in          | Number of seconds until the `access_token` expires. This is only returned if the response included an `access_token`.                                                                    | String   |
| id_token            | An [ID token](#id-token).  This is returned if the `response_type` included `id_token`.                                                                                                  | String   |
| scope               | Scopes specified in the `access_token`. Returned only if the response includes an `access_token`.                                                                                        | String   |
| state               | The unmodified `state` value from the request.                                                                                                                                           | String   |
| token_type          | The token type is always `Bearer` and is returned only when `token` is specified as a `response_type`.                                                                                   | String   |

#### Request Examples

This request initiates the authorization code flow, as signaled by `response_type=code`. The request returns an authorization code that you can use as the `code` parameter in a token request.

```
https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?client_id=0oabucvy
c38HLL1ef0h7&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocal
host%3A8080&state=state-296bc9a0-a2a2-4a57-be1a-d0e2fd9bb601&nonce=g5ly497e8ps'
```

This request does the same thing, but uses the `request` parameter to deliver a signed (HS256) JWT that contains all the query parameters:

```
https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?
  request=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJPa3RhIiwiaWF0IjoxNTEyNTE2MjIxLCJleHAiOjE1NDQwNTIyMjEsImF1ZCI6Ind3dy5leGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInN1YiI6InNqYWNrc29uQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwiRW1haWwiOiJzamFja3NvbkBleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInJlc3BvbnNlX3R5cGUiOiJjb2RlIiwicmVzcG9uc2VfbW9kZSI6ImZvcm1fcG9zdCIsInJlZGlyZWN0X3VyaSI6Im15UmVkaXJlY3RVUkkuY29tIiwic3RhdGUiOiJteVN0YXRlIiwibm9uY2UiOiJteU5vbmNlIiwic2NvcGUiOiJvcGVuaWQgb2ZmbGluZV9hY2Nlc3MifQ.TjPy2_nUerULClavBNHcpnO_Pd1DxNEjQCeSW45ALJg"
```

This request initiates the implicit flow, which gets an ID token and access token from the authorization server without the code exchange step. We use the same request as the first example, but with `response_type=id_token token`:

```
https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?client_id=0oabv6kx4qq6
h1U5l0h7&response_type=id_token token&scope=openid&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3
A8080&state=state-296bc9a0-a2a2-4a57-be1a-d0e2fd9bb601&nonce=foo'
```

### /token


<ApiOperation method="post" url="${baseUrl}/v1/token" />

This endpoint returns access tokens, ID tokens, and refresh tokens, depending on the request parameters. For [password](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/password), [client credentials](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/client-creds), and [refresh token](/authentication-guide/tokens/refreshing-tokens) flows, calling `/token` is the only step of the flow. For the [authorization code](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/auth-code) flow, calling `/token` is the second step of the flow.


> This endpoint's base URL will vary depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. For more information, see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url).

#### Request Parameters

| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| code                    | Required if `grant_type` is `authorization_code`. The value is what was returned from the [authorization endpoint](#authorize). The code has a lifetime of 60 seconds.                                                                                                                                                             | String |
| client_assertion        | Required if the `client_assertion_type` is specified. Contains the JWT signed with the `client_secret`. See [Token authentication methods](#token-authentication-methods).                                                                                                                                                         | String |
| client_assertion_type   | Indicates a JWT is being used to authenticate the client. Per the [Client Authentication spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication), the valid value is `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.                                                                            | String |
| client_id               | Required if client has a secret and client credentials are not provided in the Authorization header. See [Token authentication methods](#token-authentication-methods).                                                                                                                                                            | String |
| client_secret           | Required if the client has a secret and client credentials are not provided in the Authorization header, and if `client_assertion_type` isn't specified. This client secret is used in conjunction with `client_id` to authenticate the client application.                                                                        | String |
| code_verifier           | Required if `grant_type` is `authorization_code`  and `code_challenge` was specified in the original `/authorize` request. This value is the code verifier for [PKCE](#parameter-details). Okta uses it to recompute the `code_challenge` and verify if it matches the original `code_challenge` in the authorization request.     | String |
| grant_type              | Can be one of the following: `authorization_code`, `password`, `client_credentials`, or `refresh_token`. Determines the mechanism Okta uses to authorize the creation of the tokens.                                                                                                                                               | String |
| password                | Required if the grant_type is `password`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | String |
| redirect_uri            | Required if `grant_type` is `authorization_code`. Specifies the callback location where the authorization was sent. This value must match the `redirect_uri` used to generate the original `authorization_code`.                                                                                                                   | String |
| refresh_token           | Required if `grant_type` is `refresh_token`. The value is a valid refresh token that was returned from this endpoint previously.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | String |
| scope                   | Required if `password` is the `grant_type`. This is a list of scopes that the client wants to be included in the access token. For the `refresh_token` grant type, these scopes have to be subset of the scopes used to generate the refresh token in the first place.                                                             | String |

### /introspect


<ApiOperation method="post" url="${baseUrl}/v1/introspect" />

> This endpoint's base URL will vary depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. For more information, see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url).

This endpoint takes an access, ID, or refresh token, and returns a boolean indicating whether it is active or not.
If the token is active, additional data about the token is also returned. If the token is invalid, expired, or revoked, it is considered inactive.

> Note: Although [ID tokens](#id-token) can be sent to this endpoint, they are usually validated on the service provider or app side of a flow.

#### Request Parameters

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.

| Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Type          |

### /revoke



<ApiOperation method="post" url="${baseUrl}/v1/revoke" />

> This endpoint's base URL will vary depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. For more information, see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url).

The API takes an access or refresh token and revokes it. Revoked tokens are considered inactive at the introspection endpoint. A client may only revoke its own tokens.

#### Request Parameters

The following parameters can be posted as a part of the URL-encoded form values to the API.

| Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Type          |

For more information about token authentication, see [Token Authentication Methods](#token-authentication-methods).

#### Response Properties

A successful revocation is denoted by an HTTP 200 OK response. Note that revoking an invalid, expired, or revoked token will still be considered a success so as to not leak information.

### /logout


<ApiOperation method="get" url="${baseUrl}/v1/logout" />

> This endpoint's base URL will vary depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. For more information, see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url).

Use this operation to log out a user by removing their Okta browser session.

This endpoint takes an ID token and logs the user out of Okta if the subject matches the current Okta session. A `post_logout_redirect_uri` may be specified to redirect the browser after the logout has been performed. Otherwise, the browser is redirected to the Okta login page.

If no Okta session exists, this endpoint has no effect and the browser is redirected immediately to the Okta login page or the `post_logout_redirect_uri` (if specified).

> When making requests to the `/logout` endpoint, the browser (user agent) should be redirected to the endpoint. You can't use AJAX with this endpoint.

#### Request Parameters

The following parameters can be included in the query string of the request:

| Parameter                  | Description                                                                                                                                | Type     | Required  |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :-------- |
| id_token_hint              | A valid ID token with a subject matching the current session.                                                                              | String   | TRUE      |
| post_logout_redirect_uri   | Location to redirect to after the logout has been performed. It must match the value preregistered in Okta during client registration.     | String   | FALSE     |
| state                      | An optional value that is returned as a query parameter during the redirect to the `post_logout_redirect_uri`.                             | String   | FALSE     |

#### Request Examples

This request initiates a logout and will redirect to the Okta login page.

```bash
GET https://{baseUrl}/logout?id_token_hint=${id_token}
```

This request initiates a logout and will redirect to the `post_logout_redirect_uri`.

```bash
GET https://{baseUrl}/logout?
  id_token_hint=${id_token}&
  post_logout_redirect_uri=${post_logout_redirect_uri}&
  state=${state}
```

#### Response Example (Success)

```http
HTTP 302 Found
Location: https://example.com/post_logout/redirect&state=${state}
```

This will redirect the browser to either the Okta login page or the specified logout redirect URI.

#### Error Conditions

If the Okta session has expired (or does not exist), a logout request will simply redirect to the Okta login page or the `post_logout_redirect_uri` (if specified).

If the ID token passed via `id_token_hint` is invalid or expired, the browser will be redirected to an error page.

### /keys


<ApiOperation method="get" url="${baseUrl}/v1/keys" />

> This endpoint's base URL will vary depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. For more information, see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url).

Returns a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS), which contains the public keys that can be used to verify the signatures of tokens that you receive from your authorization server.

Any of the two or three keys listed are used to sign tokens. The order of keys in the result doesn't indicate which keys are used.

These keys can be used to locally validate JWTs returned by Okta. Standard open-source libraries are available for every major language to perform [JWS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) signature validation.

>Okta strongly recommends retrieving keys dynamically with the JWKS published in the discovery document.

>Okta also recommends caching or persisting these keys to improve performance. If you cache signing keys and automatic key rotation is enabled, be aware that verification will fail when Okta rotates the keys automatically. Clients that cache keys should periodically check the JWKS for updated signing keys.

#### Request Parameters


| Parameter   | Description                   | Param Type   | DataType   | Required   | Default |
| :---------- | :---------------------------- | :----------- | :--------- | :--------- | :------ |
| client_id   | Your app's client ID.         | Query        | String     | FALSE      | null    |


#### Response Properties

JWKS properties can be found [here](/docs/api/resources/authorization-servers#key-properties).

#### Key Rotation

The keys that are used to sign tokens are periodically changed. Okta automatically rotates your authorization server's keys on a regular basis.

Clients can opt-out of automatic key rotation by changing the client sign-on mode. In this case, passing the `client_id` with your request will retrieve the keys for that specific client.

Key rotation behaves differently with Custom Authorization Servers. For more information about key rotation with Custom Authorization Servers, see the [Authorization Servers API page](/docs/api/resources/authorization-servers#rotate-authorization-server-keys).

#### Alternative Validation

You can use an [introspection request](#introspect) for validation.

### /userinfo


<ApiOperation method="get" url="${baseUrl}/v1/userinfo" />

> This endpoint's base URL will vary depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. For more information, see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url).

Returns any claims for the currently logged-in user.

You must include an access token (returned from the [authorization endpoint](#authorize) in the HTTP Authorization header.

#### Request Example


```bash
curl -v -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" \
"https://{baseUrl}/userinfo"
```

#### Response Properties


Returns a JSON document with claims about the currently authenticated end user.

#### Response Example (Success)

```json
{
  "sub": "00uid4BxXw6I6TV4m0g3",
  "name" :"John Doe",
  "nickname":"Jimmy",
  "given_name":"John",
  "middle_name":"James",
  "family_name":"Doe",
  "profile":"https://example.com/john.doe",
  "zoneinfo":"America/Los_Angeles",
  "locale":"en-US",
  "updated_at":1311280970,

  "email_verified":true,
  "address" : { "street_address":"123 Hollywood Blvd.", "locality":"Los Angeles", "region":"CA", "postal_code":"90210", "country":"US" },
  "phone_number":"+1 (425) 555-1212"
}
```

The claims in the response are identical to those returned for the requested scopes in the `id_token` JWT, except for the `sub` claim which is always present.
See [Scope-Dependent Claims](#scope-dependent-claims-not-always-returned) for more information about individual claims.

#### Response Example (Error)

```http
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The access token is invalid"
```

#### Response Example (Error)

```http
HTTP 403 Forbidden
Expires: 0
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope", error_description="The access token must provide access to at least one of these scopes - profile, email, address or phone"
```

<ApiOperation method="get" url="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/${authServerId}/.well-known/openid-configuration" />

> This endpoint's base URL will vary depending on whether you are using a custom authorization server or not. The custom authorization server URL specifies an `authServerId`. For example, the custom Authorization Server automatically created for you by Okta has an `authServerId` value of `default`.

Returns OpenID Connect metadata about your authorization server. This information can be used by clients to programmatically configure their interactions with Okta. Custom scopes and custom claims aren't returned.

This API doesn't require any authentication.

```bash
curl -X GET \
"https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/${authServerId}/.well-known/openid-configuration?client_id=0oabzljih3rnr6aGt0h7"

## Scopes

OpenID Connect uses scope values to specify what access privileges are being requested for access tokens.
The scopes associated with access tokens determine which claims are available when they are used
to access the OIDC `/userinfo` [endpoint](/docs/api/resources/oidc#userinfo). The following scopes are supported:

| -------------    | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                 | -------------- |
| Property         | Description                                                                                                     | Required       |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| openid           | Identifies the request as an OpenID Connect request.                                                            | Yes            |
| profile          | Requests access to the end user's default profile claims.                                                       | No             |
| email            | Requests access to the `email` and `email_verified` claims.                                                     | No             |
| phone            | Requests access to the `phone_number` and `phone_number_verified` claims.                                       | No             |
| address          | Requests access to the `address` claim.                                                                         | No             |
| groups           | Requests access to the `groups` claim.                                                                          | No             |
| offline_access   | Requests a refresh token, used to obtain more access tokens without re-prompting the user for authentication.   | No             |

### Scope Values

* `openid` is required for any OpenID request connect flow. If the `openid` scope value is not present, the request may be a valid OAuth 2.0 request, but it's not an OpenID Connect request.
* `profile` requests access to these default profile claims: `name`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, `nickname`, `preferred_username`, `profile`, `picture`, `website`, `gender`, `birthdate`, `zoneinfo`,`locale`, and `updated_at`.
* `offline_access` can only be requested in combination with a `response_type` containing `code`. If the `response_type` does not contain `code`, `offline_access` will be ignored.
* For more information about `offline_access`, see the [OIDC spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess).


## Tokens and Claims

This section contains some general information about claims, as well as detailed information about access and ID tokens.

* [Access Token](#access-token)
* [ID Token](#id-token)
* [Refresh Token](#refresh-token)


### Claims

Tokens issued by Okta contain claims, which are statements about a subject (user). For example, the claim can be about a name, identity, key, group, or privilege. The claims in a security token are dependent upon the type of token, the type of credential used to authenticate the user, and the application configuration.

The claims requested by the `profile`, `email`, `address`, and `phone` scope values are returned from the `/userinfo` [endpoint](#userinfo) when a `response_type` value is used that results in an access token being issued. However, when no access token is issued (which is the case for the `response_type` value `id_token`), the resulting Claims are returned in the ID token.

### Access Token

> NOTE: The usage of the access token differs depending on whether you are using the Okta org authorization server, or a custom authorization server. While the structure of an access token retrieved from the a custom authorization server is guaranteed to not change, the structure of the access token issued by the Okta org authorization server is subject to change.

An access token is a JSON web token (JWT) encoded in Base64 URL-encoded format that contains [a header](#access-token-header), [payload](#access-token-payload), and [signature](#access-token-signature). A resource server can authorize the client to access particular resources based on the [scopes and claims](#access-token-scopes-and-claims) in the access token.

The lifetime of access token can be configured in the [Access Policies](/docs/api/resources/authorization-servers#policy-object). If the client that
issued the token is deactivated, the token is immediately and permanently invalidated. Reactivating the
client does not make the token valid again.

#### Access Token Header

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "kid": "45js03w0djwedsw"
}
```

#### Access Token Payload

  "ver": 1,
  "jti": "AT.0mP4JKAZX1iACIT4vbEDF7LpvDVjxypPMf0D7uX39RE",
  "iss": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/0oacqf8qaJw56czJi0g4",

  "scp": [
    "openid",
    "email",
    "flights",
    "custom"
  ],
  "custom_claim": "CustomValue"
}
```

#### Access Token Signature

This is a digital signature Okta generates using the public key identified by the `kid` property in the header section.

#### Access Token Scopes and Claims

Access tokens include reserved scopes and claims, and can optionally include custom scopes and claims.

Scopes are requested in the initial [authorization request](#authorize), and the Authorization Server uses the [Access Policies](/docs/api/resources/authorization-servers#policy-object) to decide if they can be granted or not. If any of the requested scopes are rejected by the Access Policies, the request will be rejected.

Based on the granted scopes, claims are added into the access token returned from the request.

##### Reserved Scopes and Claims

Okta defines a number of reserved scopes and claims which can't be overridden.

* [Reserved scopes](#reserved-scopes)
* [Reserved claims in the header section](#reserved-claims-in-the-header-section)
* [Reserved claims in the payload section](#reserved-claims-in-the-payload-section)

###### Reserved scopes

`openid`, `profile`, `email`, `address`, `phone`, `offline_access`, and `groups` are available to ID tokens and access tokens, using either the Okta Org Authorization Server or a Custom Authorization Server. For details, see [Scopes](#access-token-scopes-and-claims).
All of these scopes except `groups` are defined in the OpenID Connect specification.

###### Reserved claims in the header section

The header only includes the following reserved claims:

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                               | DataType |

| kid      | Identifies the `public-key` used to sign the `access_token`. The corresponding `public-key` can be found via the JWKS in the [discovery document](#well-knownoauth-authorization-server). | String   |

###### Reserved claims in the payload section

The payload includes the following reserved claims:

| Property | Description                                                                                                            | DataType |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| aud      | Identifies the audience (resource URI or server) that this access token is intended for.                               | String   |
| cid      | Client ID of the client that requested the access token.                                                               | String   |
| exp      | The time the access token expires, represented in Unix time (seconds).                                                 | Integer  |
| iat      | The time the access token was issued, represented in Unix time (seconds).                                              | Integer  |
| iss      | The Issuer Identifier of the response. This value will be the unique identifier for the Authorization Server instance. | String   |
| jti      | A unique identifier for this access token for debugging and revocation purposes.                                       | String   |
| scp      | Array of scopes that are granted to this access token.                                                                 | Array    |
| sub      | The subject. A name for the user or a unique identifier for the client.                                                | String   |
| uid      | A unique identifier for the user. It will not be included in the access token if there is no user bound to it.         | String   |
| ver      | The semantic version of the access token.                                                                              | Integer  |

##### Custom Scopes and Claims

You can configure custom scopes and claims for your access tokens, depending on the authorization server you are using (see [Composing Your Base URL](#composing-your-base-url)):

* For the Okta Org Authorization Server, you can configure a custom `groups` claim.
* For a Custom Authorization Server, you can configure a custom `groups` claim or any other custom scopes and claims you want.


###### Custom scopes

If the request that generates the access token contains any custom scopes, those scopes will be part of the `scp` claim together with the reserved scopes provided from the [OIDC specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). The names of your custom scopes must conform to the [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3).

> Scope names can contain the characters `<` (less than) or `>` (greater than), but not both characters.

###### Custom claims

Custom claims are associated with scopes. In general, granting a custom scope means a custom claim is added to the token. However, the specifics depend on which claims are requested, whether the request is to the Okta Org Authorization Server or a Custom Authorization Server, and some configuration choices.

**Quick reference: which token has which claims?**

Custom claims are configured in the Custom Authorization Server, and returned depending on whether it matches a scope in the request, and also depending on the token type, authorization server type, and the token and claim configuration set in the authorization server:

* Base claims are always returned in ID tokens and access tokens for both authorization server types (Okta Org Authorization Server or Custom Authorization Server).
* Scope-dependent claims are returned in tokens depending on the response type for either authorization server type. See [the second table in the Scope-Dependent Claims topic](#scope-dependent-claims-not-always-returned) for details.
* Custom claims require configuration in the Custom Authorization Server. You can specify that claims are to be returned in each token (ID or access) always, or only when requested. Assuming a claim matches a requested scope,
    it is returned to the ID token if there is no access token requested.

The ID token or access token may not include all claims associated with the requested scopes. The [UserInfo endpoint](#userinfo) always contains a full set of claims for the requested scopes.

### ID Token

OpenID Connect introduces an ID token which is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about an authentication event and claims about the authenticated user.

Clients can use any of the following sequences of operations to obtain an ID token:
* [Authorization code flow](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/auth-code) or [Authorization code with PKCE flow](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/auth-code-pkce) -- the client obtains an authorization code from the authorization server's [/authorize endpoint](#authorize) and uses it to obtain an ID token and an access token from the authorization server's [/token endpoint](#token).
* [Implicit flow](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/implicit) -- the client obtains an ID token and optionally an access token directly from the authorization server's `/authorize` endpoint.

Clients should always [validate ID tokens](/authentication-guide/tokens/validating-id-tokens) to ensure their integrity.

The ID tokens returned by the `/authorize` endpoint (implicit flow) or the `/token` endpoint (authorization code flow)
are identical, except if:

* You are using the implicit flow. If so, the `nonce` parameter is required in the initial `/authorize` request, and the ID token will include a `nonce` claim that should be validated to make sure it matches the `nonce` value passed to `/authorize.`
* Both an ID and and access token were requested. If so, the ID token will include the `at_hash` [parameter](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken) which can be validated against the hash of the access token to guarantee the access token is genuine.

The ID Token consists of three period-separated, Base64 URL-encoded JSON segments: [a header](#id-token-header), [the payload](#id-token-payload), and [the signature](#id-token-signature).

Be aware of the following before you work with scope-dependent claims:

* To protect against arbitrarily large numbers of groups matching the group filter, the groups claim has a limit of 100.
If more than 100 groups match the filter, then the request fails. Expect that this limit may change in the future.
For more information about configuring an app for OpenID Connect, including group claims, see [OpenID Connect Wizard](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard.htm).
* **Important:** Scope-dependent claims are returned differently depending on the values in `response_type` and the scopes requested:

* The full set of claims for the requested scopes is available via the [/oauth2/v1/userinfo](#userinfo) endpoint. Call this endpoint using the access token.

### Refresh Token

Refresh tokens are opaque. More information about using them can be found in the [Authentication Guide](/authentication-guide/tokens/refreshing-tokens).

## Token Authentication Methods

If you configure your client to use a `client_secret` [Client Authentication Method](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication), provide the [`client_id` and `client_secret`](#request-parameters-1)
using either of the following methods:

* Provide `client_id` and `client_secret`
  in an Authorization header in the Basic auth scheme (`client_secret_basic`). For authentication with Basic auth, an HTTP header with the following format must be provided with the POST request:
  ```bash
  Authorization: Basic ${Base64(<client_id>:<client_secret>)}
  ```
* Provide the `client_id` and `client_secret`
  as additional parameters to the POST body (`client_secret_post`)
* Provide `client_id` in a JWT that you sign with the `client_secret`
  using HMAC algorithms HS256, HS384, or HS512. Specify the JWT in `client_assertion` and the type, `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`, in `client_assertion_type` in the request.

If you configure your client to use `private_key_jwt` [Client Authentication Method](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication) you must provide the `client_id` in a JWT that you sign with your private key.
* The private key that was used to sign must have the corresponding public key registered in the client's [JWKSet](oauth-clients#json-web-key-set).
* Sign the JWT with one of the following signature algorithms: RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384 or ES512.
* Specify the JWT in `client_assertion` and the type, `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`, in `client_assertion_type` in the request.

Use only one of these methods in a single request or an error will occur.

### Token Claims for Client Authentication with Client Secret or Private Key JWT

If you use a JWT for client authentication (`client_secret_jwt` or `private_key_jwt`), use the following token claims:

| Token Claims   | Description                                                                             | Type    |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----  |
| aud            | Required. The full URL of the resource you're using the JWT to authenticate to.         | String  |
| exp            | Required. The expiration time of the token in seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.        | Integer |
| jti            | Optional. The identifier of the token.                                                  | String  |
| iat            | Optional. The issuing time of the token in seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC.           | Integer |
| iss            | Required. The issuer of the token. This value must be the same as the `client_id`.      | String  |
| sub            | Required. The subject of the token. This value must be the same as the `client_id`.     | String  |

Parameter Details

* If `jti` is specified, the token can only be used once. So, for example, subsequent token requests won't succeed.
* The `exp` claim will fail the request if the expiration time is more than one hour in the future or has already expired.
* If `iat` is specified, then it must be a time before the request is received.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into trouble setting up an authorization server or performing other tasks for OAuth 2.0/OIDC, use the following suggestions to resolve your issues.

### Start with the System Log

The system log contains detailed information about why a request was denied and other useful information.

### Limits

* Scopes are unique per authorization server.

* The `audiences` value you specify is an array of String. If the string contains ":" it must be a valid URI.

* Tokens can expire, be explicitly revoked at the endpoint, or implicitly revoked by a change in configuration.

* Token revocation can be implicit in two ways: token expiration or a change to the source.
    * Expiration happens at different times:
        * ID token expires after one hour.
        * Access token expiration is configured in a policy, but is always between five minutes and one day.
        * Refresh Token expiration depends on two factors: 1) Expiration is configured in an Access Policy, no limits,
          but must be greater than or equal to the access token lifetime, and 2) Revocation if the Refresh Token
          isn't exercised within a specified time. Configure the specified time in an Access Policy, with a minimum of ten minutes.

    * Revocation happens when a configuration is changed or deleted:
        * User deactivation or deletion.
        * Configuration in the authorization server is changed or deleted.
        * The [client app](https://help.okta.com/en/prev/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard.htm#OIDCWizard) is deactivated, changed, unassigned, or deleted.

### Subtle Behavior

Some behaviors aren't obvious:

* A user must be assigned to the client in Okta for the client to get access tokens from that client.
You can assign the client directly (direct user assignment) or indirectly (group assignment).

* If you haven't created a rule in a policy in the authorization server to allow the client, user, and
scope combination that you want, the request fails.
To resolve, create at least one rule in a policy in the authorization server for the relevant resource
that specifies client, user, and scope.

* OpenID Connect scopes are granted by default, so if you are requesting only those scopes ( `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `address`, `phone`, or `offline_access` ), you don't need to define any scopes for them, but you need a policy and rule
in a Custom Authorization Server. The rule grants the OpenID Connect scopes by default, so they don't need to be configured in the rule.
Token expiration times depend on how they are defined in the rules, and which policies and rules match the request.

* OpenID scopes can be requested with custom scopes. For example, a request can include `openid` and a custom scope.

* The evaluation of a policy always takes place during the initial authentication of the user (or of the client in case of client credentials flow). If the flow is not immediately finished, such as when a token is requested using `authorization_code` grant type, the policy is not evaluated again, and a change in the policy after the user or client is initially authenticated won't affect the continued flow.
