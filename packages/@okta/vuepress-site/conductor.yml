# This file instructs conductor to set up S3 redirections. Each redirect has a from and to property, and
# conductor will set up a 301 redirect for each entry.
# For the 'from:' attribute, include the leading slash, but not a leading slash.
# For the 'to:' attribute, any valid URL path can be used, but make sure to include the leading slash.
# Some examples:
#   - from: /old.html
#     to: /new.html
#   - from: /old-path
#     to: /new-path
#   - from: /iossetupinstructions.html
#     to: /ios/setup/instructions.html
