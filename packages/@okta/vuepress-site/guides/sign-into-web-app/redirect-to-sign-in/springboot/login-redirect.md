When accessing protected routes, Spring Security redirects the user to an Okta sign-in page automatically. You can control which routes are protected with code (covered in <GuideLink link="../require-authentication/">Require Authentication</GuideLink>).

You can also give the user a **Sign In** button or link. The link must redirect to `/oauth2/authorization/okta`:

```html
<a href="/oauth/authorization/okta">Sign In</a>
```
