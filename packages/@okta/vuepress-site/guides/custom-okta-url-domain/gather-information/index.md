title: Gather Information
---
Before you get started, make sure that you have the following information:

* A domain, for example, `example.com`.
* A subdomain that you want to use, for example, `login.example.com`. 
* A valid TLS certificate for your subdomain, if you have one. If you don't, generate one. You can use a service to do that, such as:
    - [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/)
    - [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

    Make sure that you have the TLS certificate for your subdomain (PEM-encoded) and the private key (PEM-encoded) before beginning.
