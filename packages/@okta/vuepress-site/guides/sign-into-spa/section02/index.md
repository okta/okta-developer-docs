## Create an Okta Application

In Okta, applications are OpenID Connect (OIDC) clients that can use Okta Authorization Servers to authenticate users. Your Okta org already has a default Authorization Server, so you just need to create an OIDC client that uses it.

1. Sign in to the Okta Developer Console, click **Applications**, and then **Add Application**.
2. Select **Single-Page App (SPA)** as the platform, and then click **Next**.
3. Provide a name for your SPA application or leave the default value.
4. Enter the correct port in the **Base URIs** box, for example: `http://localhost:{port}`, and then enter the correct port in the **Login redirect URIs** box, for example: `http://localhost:{port}/implicit/callback`. 

If you are running this app locally and are using the defaults from the appropriate documentation, then your port is:

<StackSelector snippet="port"/>

5. Leave **Implicit** selected for **Grant Types Allowed**.
6. Click **Done**.
7. On the **General** tab of the app that you just created, click **Edit** and enter the correct URI in the **Logout redirect URIs** box. <!-- See [Sign Users Out]for more information. -->

### Things You Need
After you create the application, there are two values that you need:

* **Client ID** - Find it in the applications list or on the **General** tab of a specific application.
* **Org URL** - Find it on the Developer console dashboard in the upper-right corner. 

These values are used in your application to set up the OpenID Connect flow with Okta.
