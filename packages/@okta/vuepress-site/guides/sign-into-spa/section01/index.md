# Sign Users into Your Single-Page App

This guide walks you through how to sign users into your single-page app (SPA) and supports apps created using:

* Angular
* React
* Vue

If you are building a web app that is served by a server framework, see [Sign Users into Your Web App]. If you are building a mobile app, see [Sign Users into Your Mobile App].

# Before You Begin

These instructions assume that you: 

- Have an Okta Developer organization. If you don't, you can get one here: <https://developer.okta.com/signup>
- Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an app created or are new to creating an app, start with the appropriate documentation. It'll walk you through the creation of an app, creating routes, and other application development essentials:

<StackSelector snippet="create-app"/>

> Note: If you'd prefer to download a complete sample application, you can use ours:

<StackSelector snippet="samples"/>

If you meet all of the prerequisites, then you can move on to the first step, which is creating an Okta application.
