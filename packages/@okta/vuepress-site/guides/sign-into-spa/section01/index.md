This guide walks you through how to sign users into your single-page app (SPA) and supports apps created using:

* Angular
* React
* Vue

<!-- If you are building a web app that is served by a server framework, see [Sign Users into Your Web App]. If you are building a mobile app, see [Sign Users into Your Mobile App]. -->

## Before You Begin

These instructions assume that you: 

* Have an Okta Developer organization. If you don't, you can get one here: <https://developer.okta.com/signup>
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an app created or are new to creating an app, start with the appropriate documentation. It'll walk you through the creation of an app, creating routes, and other application development essentials:
