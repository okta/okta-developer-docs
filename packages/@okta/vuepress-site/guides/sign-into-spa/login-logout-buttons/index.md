## Provide the Login/Logout Buttons (Redirect to the Sign-in Page) 

In the relevant location in your application, you want to provide `Login` and `Logout` buttons for the user.

When a user clicks the **Login** button, they are redirected to the Okta hosted sign-in page where they can authenticate.

<!-- >> Note: To customize this sign-in page, see the [Customization Guide](customization-guide-link). -->
