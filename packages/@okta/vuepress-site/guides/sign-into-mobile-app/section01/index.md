title: Sign Users into Your Mobile Apps
---
This guide walks you through how to sign users into your mobile applications and supports these operating systems:

- Android (Java)
- iOS (Swift)
- React Native

If you are building a web app that is served by a server framework, see [Sign Users into Your Web App]. If you are building a single-page app, see [Sign Users into Your Single-Page App].

# Before You Begin

These instructions assume that you: 

- Have an Okta Developer organization. If you don't, you can get one here: <https://developer.okta.com/signup>
- Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

> Note: If you'd prefer to download a complete sample application, you can use ours:

If you meet all of the prerequisites, then you can move on to the first step, which is creating an Okta application.
