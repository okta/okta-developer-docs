This guide shows you how to use Okta as the user store for your mobile application and sign users in to your app.

<!-- If you are building a web app that is served by a server framework, see [Sign Users in to Your Web App]. If you are building a mobile app, see [Sign Users in to Your Mobile App]. -->

This guide assumes that you:

* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an existing app, or are new to building apps, start with this documentation:
