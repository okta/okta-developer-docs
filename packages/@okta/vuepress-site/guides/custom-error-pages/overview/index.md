You can [customize the Okta hosted sign-in page](/guides/custom-hosted-signin/) to fit your application's look and feel, but that's just one piece of a seamless user experience. If an error occurs during sign-in, Okta may need to display an error page to the user. You can customize the error page using an embedded HTML editor provided on the **Custom Error Pages** tab of the **Customization** page. 

By using this feature along with the [customize the Okta URL domain](/guides/custom-url-domain/) (required) and the [customize the Okta hosted sign-in page](/guides/custom-hosted-signin/), you can use Okta-hosted flows and create a fully customized end-user sign-in experience.

## Common Questions
**In what situations does Okta serve error pages to the user?**
The error page appears when a critical error occurs or an application is misconfigured.  <!-- Link to Concepts: Okta-hosted functionality -->

**What can I customize on the error page?**
You can add HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to the page.

## Before You Begin
Before you can get started customizing error pages, you must have already [customized your Okta URL domain](/guides/custom-url-domain/). A custom error page appears only when an end user accesses Okta through your custom URL domain. Otherwise, the default Okta error page appears.
