title: Before You Begin

This guide walks you through how to sign users into your existing web app. It is available for the following frameworks:

* Node (Express)
* Java (Spring)
* .NET (ASP.NET)
* .NET (ASP.NET Core)

## Before You Begin
These instructions assume that you: 

* Have an Okta Developer Edition organization. (Don't have one? [Create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).)
* Know the basics of building Web applications.
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an app created, or are new to creating an app, start with the appropriate documentation. It'll walk you through the creation of an app, creating routes, and other application development essentials:

> Note: If you'd prefer to download a complete sample application, you can use ours:

If you meet all of the prerequisites, then you can move on to the first step, which is creating an Okta application.
