# Sign Users into Your Web App

This guide walks you through how to sign users into your existing web app. It is available for the following frameworks:

* Node (Express)
* Java (Spring)
* .NET (ASP.NET)
* .NET (ASP.NET Core)

## Before You Begin
These instructions assume that you: 

* Are building Web app that's rendered by a server, otherwise see [Sign Users into a Single-Page App](sign-into-spa). If you are building a mobile app, see [Sign Users into a Mobile App](sign-into-mobile-app). If you are building an API, see [Protect an API].
* Have an Okta Developer organization. If you don't, you can get one here: <https://developer.okta.com/signup>
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

If you don't have an app created, or are new to creating an app, start with the appropriate documentation. It'll walk you through the creation of an app, creating routes, and other application development essentials:

> Note: If you'd prefer to download a complete sample application, you can use ours:

If you meet all of the prerequisites, then you can move on to the first step, which is creating an Okta application.
