# Protect Your API Endpoints

This guide walks you through how to add authentication to your API endpoints and supports these languages:

* Node (Express)
* Java (Spring)
* .NET (ASP.NET)
* .NET (ASP.NET Core)

If the API is being called by a single-page app or mobile app, first learn how to [Sign Users into Your Single-Page App] or [Sign Users into Your Mobile App].

## Before You Begin

These instructions assume that you: 

* Have an Okta Developer organization. If you don't, you can get one here: <https://developer.okta.com/signup>
* Have a project or application that you want to add authentication to.

> Note: If you'd prefer to download a complete sample application, you can use ours:

If you meet all of the prerequisites, then you can move on to the first step, which is adding and configuring packages.
