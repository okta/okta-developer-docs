The [Spring Boot Getting Started Guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) teaches you the basics of building a Spring Boot application.

Or, if you want to skip this guide and just download a working sample app, download our [Spring Boot Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/samples-java-spring/tree/master/resource-server) or our [WebFlux example](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/tree/master/examples/webflux-resource-server).
