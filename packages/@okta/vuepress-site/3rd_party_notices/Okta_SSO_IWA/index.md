    OF THE WORK OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE AUTHOR OR THE PUBLISHER HAS
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.  TERMINATION.

    1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically upon any breach by You of any term of
        this License. Individuals or entities who have received
        Derivative Works from You under this License, however, will not
        have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
        entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
        1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 will survive any termination of
        this License.

    2.  If You bring a copyright, trademark, patent or any other

        the Work). Notwithstanding the above, the Author reserves the
        right to release the Work under different license terms or to
        stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
        any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
        any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
        under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
        in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

7.  PUBLISHER. The parties hereby confirm that the Publisher shall not,
    under any circumstances, be responsible for and shall not have any
    liability in respect of the subject matter of this License. The
    Publisher makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work

        the head office of the Author or if the Author is an individual,
        the laws of location of the principal place of residence of
        the Author.

    2.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
        under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
        enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
        and without further action by the parties to this License, such
        provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
        make such provision valid and enforceable.

    3.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
        no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
        writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
        or consent.

        parties with respect to the Work licensed herein. There are no
        understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
