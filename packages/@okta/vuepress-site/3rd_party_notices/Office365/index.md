A "contribution" is the original software, or any additions or changes
to the software.

A "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under
this license.

"Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly
on its contribution.

any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents
