3. GRANT OF PATENT LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. REDISTRIBUTION. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
following conditions:

a.  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
    copy of this License; and

b.  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that You changed the files; and

    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

d.  If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

    part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
    places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
    Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
    provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
    generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
    notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
    informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
    add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
    Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
    construed as modifying the License. 

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
  provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
  Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
  distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
  in this License.

5. SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTIONS. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this

to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,

MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
exercise of permissions under this License.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.

9. ACCEPTING WARRANTY OR ADDITIONAL LIABILITY. While redistributing the
Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.
