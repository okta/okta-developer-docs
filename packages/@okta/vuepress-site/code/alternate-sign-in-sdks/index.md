# SDKs for alternate sign-in methods

Okta recommends signing users in using an Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget. For those not following this approach, Okta maintains the following SDKs. However, when using these solutions, some aspects of [Identity Threat Protection](https://www.okta.com/products/identity-threat-protection/) aren't as fully integrated with the sign-in process.

Select the task that you want to perform to access more information on alternate ways to set up a sign-in experience in your app:

* Sign in to Identity Engine
  * [From a single-page app](#sign-in-to-identity-engine-from-a-single-page-app)
  * [From a server-side web app](#sign-in-to-identity-engine-from-a-server-side-web-app)
  * [From a mobile app](#sign-in-to-identity-engine-from-a-mobile-app)
* Sign in to Classic Engine
  * [From a single-page app](#from-a-single-page-app)
  * [From a server-side web app](#from-a-server-side-web-app)
  * [From a mobile app](#from-a-mobile-app)

> **Tip:** See [Recommended SDKs](/code/) to find SDKs, samples, and documentation for the recommended sign-in experiences with Identity Engine, and other fully supported tasks.

## Sign in to Identity Engine from a single-page app

Instead of redirecting to the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget, you can create a custom sign-in page in your single-page app and implement [an appropriate authentication flow](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#what-kind-of-client-are-you-building) between the app and Identity Engine.

There are two ways to create a custom sign-in page. In both cases, enable the flow using auth.js or a framework-specific wrapper around it:

1. Embed the Okta Sign-In Widget in a web page.

> **Note:** All Okta JS libraries are hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40okta).

## Sign in to Identity Engine from a server-side web app

Instead of redirecting to the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget, you can create a custom sign-in page in your server-side web app and implement [an appropriate authentication flow](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#what-kind-of-client-are-you-building) between the app and Identity Engine.

> **Warning:** When a server-side app uses the embedded SDK as a proxy between client apps and Okta servers, a request context for the client apps (IP address, user agent, and device) is required. This feeds into the risk assessment made by Okta [Identity Threat Protection](https://www.okta.com/products/identity-threat-protection/) for any sign-in flow and enables policies based on these request context values. However, the proxy always passes in the app server's request context rather than the client context. Hence, ITP and some context-reliant authentication policies aren’t effective if you choose to use this custom sign-in experience.

There are two ways to create a custom sign-in page:

1. Embed the Okta Sign-In Widget in the page.

## Sign in to Identity Engine from a mobile app

Instead of redirecting to the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget, you can create a custom sign-in page for your mobile app and implement [an appropriate authentication flow](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#what-kind-of-client-are-you-building) between the app and Identity Engine. Android and iOS developers should use the Identity Engine SDK for their respective platforms.

> **Note:** The Mobile and Identity Engine SDKs share a [modular architecture](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2022/08/30/introducing-the-new-okta-mobile-sdks#modularized-architecture).

## Sign in to Classic Engine

Okta recommends upgrading your apps from Classic Engine to Identity Engine to take advantage of its many new features. If an upgrade isn’t possible right now, use the following content to set up a sign-in experience for your users in Classic Engine.

### From a single-page app

The Okta Auth JavaScript SDK (auth.js) supports custom sign-in page interactions with Classic Engine as well as Identity Engine.

There are two ways to create a custom sign-in page. In both cases, enable the flow using auth.js or a framework-specific wrapper around it.

1. Embed the Okta Sign-In Widget in a web page.

> **Note:** All Okta JS libraries are hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40okta).

### From a server-side web app

Classic Engine is fully OAuth 2.0/OIDC compatible. To initiate the OIDC exchange, use your preferred OIDC SDK or the Okta OIDC middleware SDK listed in the following table. If you can't use OIDC to handle the sign-in flow, use an Okta Authentication SDK to interact with the authentication API.

### From a mobile app

The classic Auth SDKs for [Android](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-java) (Java) and [iOS](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-swift) (Swift) are now legacy Okta SDKs. The new Mobile SDKs replaced them and are compatible with Classic Engine by using the SessionTokenFlow class.
