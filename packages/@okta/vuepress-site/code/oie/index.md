# Identity Engine SDKs & Samples

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

## What's new

[Identity Engine](/docs/concepts/ie-intro/) introduces new capabilities and design patterns. To take advantage of these new features and provide a better development experience, new Okta Identity Experience (IDX) SDKs are available and recommended for orgs using Identity Engine.

Experiment with sample apps that showcase Identity Engine using the following [authentication approaches]:
<!-- We also have new sample apps for you to experiment with Identity Engine authentication, for multiple authentication approaches: -->

* Redirect &mdash; These sample apps demonstrate redirecting users to an Okta-hosted sign-in page, and then receiving users redirected back from Okta after sign in. This approach is recommended for most developers, as it is easier to build and maintain.
<!--This approach is much easier to build and maintain, and is recommended for most developers.-->

* Embedded &mdash; These sample apps demonstrate embedding the Okta Sign-In Widget in your app as a package dependency.

Learn how to implement each approach with these IDX SDKs and sample apps in the [redirect authentication guide] and [embedded authentication guide].

Orgs using Identity Engine can also continue to use current SDKs and tools, including  Authentication, Management, and Hooks SDKs. You can find those SDKs for your stack from the [Languages & SDKs overview](/code/).
