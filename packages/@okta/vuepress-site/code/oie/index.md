# Identity Engine SDKs & Samples

<ApiLifecycle access="ie" />

## What's new

[Identity Engine](/docs/concepts/ie-intro/) introduces new identity management capabilities with greater flexibility and customization. To take advantage of these new features and for a better development experience, use the Identity Experience (IDX) SDKs to manage authentication in your apps. These new SDKs are recommended for orgs using the Identity Engine.
<!-- Identity Engine introduces new capabilities and design patterns. To take advantage of these new features and provide a better development experience, new Okta Identity Experience (IDX) SDKs are available and recommended for orgs using Identity Engine. -->

Experiment with sample apps that showcase Identity Engine using the following [authentication approaches](/docs/concepts/hosted-vs-embedded/):
<!-- We also have new sample apps for you to experiment with Identity Engine authentication, for multiple authentication approaches: -->

* **Redirect**: These sample apps demonstrate how to redirect users to an Okta-hosted sign-in page, and then receive users redirected back from Okta after sign in. This approach is recommended for most developers, as it is easier to build and maintain.
<!--This approach is much easier to build and maintain, and is recommended for most developers.-->

* **Embedded**: These sample apps demonstrate how to embed the Okta Sign-In Widget in an app as a package dependency.

Learn how to implement each approach with these IDX SDKs and sample apps in the [Redirect authentication with the sample apps and Identity Engine guide](/docs/guides/sampleapp-oie-redirectauth/) and [Building your app with Embedded SDK guide](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-start-with-use-case/).

Orgs using Identity Engine can also continue to use current SDKs and tools. You can find those SDKs for your stack from the [Languages & SDKs overview](/code/).
