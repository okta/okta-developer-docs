The sample app is the Golang embedded Sign-In Widget sample app (archived).

1. Configure your Okta org by completing the steps in [Set up your Okta org for a password factor only use case](/docs/guides/set-up-org/#set-up-your-okta-org-for-a-password-factor-only-use-case).
1. [Download and set up the sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/go/main/).
1. Open the embedded widget project using Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE. The directory path to the sample app directory is: `samples-golang/identity-engine/embedded-sign-in-widget`.
1. Add an `okta.yaml` configuration file. See [Option 1: Create a configuration file](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/go/main/#option-1-create-a-configuration-file) for more information on how to configure and where to place the configuration file.
1. From the command line:
   1. Go to the project directory (`/samples-golang/identity-engine/embedded-sign-in-widget/`).
   1. Call `go get` to install dependencies.
   1. Call `go run main.go` to start the app.
1. In a web browser, go to `http://localhost:8000/`. The app's landing page appears.
1. Click **Login**.
1. On the sign-in page, enter the username (email) and password that you've used in [Create your Okta account](/docs/guides/set-up-org/#create-your-okta-account).
1. If you successfully sign in, you see a signed in page customized with your name.

### Troubleshoot

* If the "There was an unexpected internal error. Please try again." message appears instead of the Sign-In Widget, then verify that CORS is enabled. Follow the steps in [Add a trusted origin and enable CORS](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/go/main/#add-a-trusted-origin-and-enable-cors) to enable CORS.

### Start your work with the use cases

After you successfully run the sample app, the next step is to build your integration. Use the sample app as your guide. See [Load the Widget](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-widget-use-case-load/go/main/) to start using the Widget and explore the available use cases.
