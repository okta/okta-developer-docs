There are two main repositories for the Golang embedded SDK and sample apps (both archived):

* Okta-idx-golang (archived)—enables Golang projects to use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider. The SDK communicates with the Okta Identity Engine to authenticate and register users.

* Samples-golang (archived)—contains sample apps that demonstrate the various use cases supported by the embedded SDK:

  * `samples-golang/identity-engine/embedded-auth-with-sdk`—sample app that uses the embedded SDK to authenticate the user

  * `samples-golang/identity-engine/embedded-sign-in-widget`—sample app that uses the embedded Sign-In Widget to authenticate the user

To use the sample apps, clone the samples-golang (archived) repository to your local directory.
