# Working With OAuth 2.0 Tokens

Once you have [implemented your preferred OAuth 2.0 flow](/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/), you will need to know how work with the tokens that you have been granted.

More information about access tokens can be found [here](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#access-token).

Additional information about ID tokens can be found [here](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#id-token).

This section will help you understand token validation, revocation, as well as how to use a refresh token to get a new access token.
