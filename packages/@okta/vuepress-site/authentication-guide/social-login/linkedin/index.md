# LinkedIn

> **Important:** LinkedIn is deprecating their Social Login V1 API on March 1, 2019. Functionality to add new LinkedIn identity providers has been disabled while we upgrade to LinkedIn's Social Login V2 API.

##### 1. Set Up a LinkedIn App

1.1. Go to <https://developer.linkedin.com/> and register for a developer account if you haven't already done so.

1.2. Create a LinkedIn app here: <https://www.linkedin.com/developer/apps>.

1.3. Save the OAuth client ID and secret values so you can add them to the Okta configuration in the next section.

1.4. Under "Default Application Permissions", make sure that `r_basicprofile` and `r_emailaddress` are selected. You can leave the "Authorized redirect URLs" section blank for now, you will return to it later.

##### 2. Configure LinkedIn as an Identity Provider in Okta

2.1. Sign in to your Okta org.

2.2. On the main page, hover your cursor over **Users** until the menu opens, then click on **Social & Identity Providers**.

2.3. On the Identity Providers page, click on **Add Identity Provider** > **Add LinkedIn**

* **Name:** We suggest using the name you would expect to see on a button, something like "Log in to LinkedIn".
* **Client Id:** Paste in the App ID that you got from LinkedIn in step 1.3 above.
* **Client Secret:** Paste in the App Secret that you got from LinkedIn in step 1.3 above.
* **Scopes:** Leave set to the default.

> For more information about these as well as the Advanced Settings, see [Social Identity Provider Settings](/authentication-guide/social-login/social-settings).

2.4. Once you have completed all the fields, click on **Add Identity Provider**. You will be returned to the main "Identity Providers" page.

2.5. On the "Identity Providers" page, you should find the LinkedIn Identity Provider that you just added. Once you have found the entry, copy both the "Authorize URL" and "Redirect URI" (ending in `/authorize/callback`).

##### 3. Add the Okta Redirect URI to LinkedIn

3.1. In your LinkedIn app's page, find the "OAuth 2.0" section under "Authorized Redirect URLs" paste in the Redirect URI from step 2.5 above and click **Add**.

3.2. Click **Update**.

##### 4. Register an OpenID Connect Application in Okta

4.1. Back on the Okta administrator UI, click on **Applications**.

4.2. Click **Add Application**.

4.3. On the "Add Application" page, click **Create New App**.

4.4. Select the appropriate platform for your use case and choose a name for your new application.

4.5. Add one or more Redirect URIs. This is where the user will be directed to after they have authenticated with LinkedIn.

4.6. Assign the group of your choosing (if you [set Group Assignments](/authentication-guide/social-login/social-settings) for your app), or assign "Everyone".

4.7. Under "Grant type allowed", make sure "Implicit" is enabled.

4.8. Click **Done** and you will arrive on the page for your new application.

4.9. In the "Client Credentials" section, copy your "Client ID", which you will use to complete your Authorize URL in the next step.

##### 5. Complete Your Authorize URL

The Okta Identity Provider that you created in section 2 above generated an Authorize URL with a number of blank parameters that you must now fill-in:

* **client_id:** use the client_id value you copied in step 4.9.
* **scope:** Determines the claims that are returned in the ID token. This should have at least `openid`.
* **response_type:** Determines which flow is used. This should be `id_token`.
* **response_mode:** Determines how the authorization response should be returned. This should be `fragment`.
* **state:** Protects against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
* **nonce:** A string included in the returned ID Token. Use it to associate a client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks.
* **redirect_uri:** The location where Okta returns a browser after the user has finished authenticating against their social login provider. This URL must start with "https" and must match one of the Redirect URIs that you configured previously in step 4.5.

For a full explanation of all these parameters, see: [/authorize Request parameters](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#request-parameters)

An example of a complete URL looks like this: `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/authorize?idp=0oaaq9pjc2ujmFZexample&client_id=GkGw4K49N4UEE1example&response_type=id_token&response_mode=fragment&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FyourAppUrlHere.com%2Fsocial_auth&state=WM6D&nonce=YsG76jo`

#### Using LinkedIn for Login

There are four primary ways to kick off the flow to sign-in with LinkedIn.

**HTML Link**

One option is to create a link that the user clicks in order to log in. The HREF for that link would be the Authorize URL that you created previously:

`<a href="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/authorize?idp=0oaaq9pjc2ujmFZexample&client_id=GkGw4K49N4UEE1example&response_type=id_token&response_mode=fragment&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FyourAppUrlHere.com%2Fsocial_auth&state=WM6D&nonce=YsG76jo">Login With LinkedIn</a>`

After clicking this link, the user will be prompted to sign in with the social provider. After they succeed they will be returned to the specified `redirect_uri` along with an ID Token in JWT format.

**Custom Okta-hosted Sign-in Page**

If you have configured an [Custom Okta-hosted Sign-in Page](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Settings/custom-okta-hosted-sign-in-page.htm), you can add a "Login with LinkedIn" button by adding the following code:

```js
idps: [
  {type: 'LINKEDIN', id: '$Your_LinkedIn_IDP_ID_Here'}
]
```

**Okta Sign-in Widget**

Okta also offers an easily embeddable JavaScript widget that reproduces the look and behavior of the standard Okta sign-in page. Adding a "Login with LinkedIn" button is as simple as adding the following code to your configuration:

```js
idps: [
  {type: 'LINKEDIN', id: '$Your_LinkedIn_IDP_ID_Here'}
]
```

You can find out more about it [on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#okta-sign-in-widget). Implementing login with LinkedIn would use the Widget's [OpenID Connect authentication flow](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#openid-connect).

**AuthJS**

If you don't want pre-built views, or need deeper levels of customization, then you can use the same AuthJS SDK that the Sign-in Widget is built with. For further information see [the AuthJS GitHub repo](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#install). Implementing login with LinkedIn would use the SDK's [OpenID Connect authentication flow](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#openid-connect-options).
