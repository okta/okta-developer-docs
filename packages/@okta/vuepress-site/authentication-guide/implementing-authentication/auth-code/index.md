# Implement the Authorization Code Flow

If you are building a server-side (or "web") application that is capable of securely storing secrets, then the authorization code flow is the recommended method for controlling access to it.

At a high-level, this flow has the following steps:

- Your application directs the browser to the Okta Sign-In page, where the user authenticates.
- The browser receives an authorization code from your Okta authorization server.
- The authorization code is passed to your application.
- Your application sends this code to Okta, and Okta returns access and ID tokens, and optionally a refresh token.
- Your application can now use these tokens to call the resource server (for example an API) on behalf of the user.

For more information on the authorization code flow, including why to use it, see [our OAuth 2.0 overview](/authentication-guide/auth-overview/#authorization-code-flow).

### 1. Setting up your Application

You set up your OpenID Connect application inside the Okta Developer Console:

1. From the Applications page, choose **Add Application**.
2. On the Create New Application page, select **Web**.
3. Fill-in the Application Settings, then click **Done**. The "Login redirect URIs" must match a URI that your user can be redirected to with their authorization code. See below for more details.

### 2. Using the Authorization Code Flow

To get an authorization code, you make a request to your authorization server's `/authorize` endpoint. If you are using the default Okta authorization server, then your request URL would look something like this:

```
https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize?client_id=0oabucvy
c38HLL1ef0h7&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocal
host%3A8080&state=state-296bc9a0-a2a2-4a57-be1a-d0e2fd9bb601'
```

Note the parameters that are being passed:

- `client_id` matches the Client ID of your Okta OAuth application that you created above. You can find it at the bottom of your application's General tab.
- `response_type` is `code`, indicating that we are using the authorization code grant type.
- `scope` is `openid`, which means that the `/token` endpoint will return an ID token. For more information about scopes, see [here](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#scopes).
- `redirect_uri` is the callback location where the user-agent will be directed to along with the `code`. This must match one of the "Login redirect URIs" you specified when you were creating your Okta application in Step 1.
- `state` is an arbitrary alphanumeric string that the authorization server will reproduce when redirecting the user-agent back to the client. This is used to help prevent cross-site request forgery.

For more information on these parameters, see [the OAuth 2.0 API reference](/docs/api/resources/oidc/#authorize).

If the user does not have an existing session, this will open the Okta Sign-in Page. If they have an existing session, or after they authenticate, they will arrive at the specified `redirect_uri` along with a `code`:

```
http://localhost:8080/?code=P5I7mdxxdv13_JfXrCSq&state=state-296bc9a0-a2a2-4a57
-be1a-d0e2fd9bb601
```

This code will remain valid for 60 seconds, during which it can be exchanged for tokens.

### 3. Exchanging the Code for Tokens

To exchange this code for access and ID tokens, you pass it to your authorization server's `/token` endpoint. If you are using the default Okta authorization server, then your request would look something like this:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'authorization: Basic MG9hY...' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data 'grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080&code=P59yPm1_X1gxtdEOEZjn'
```

> Important: The call to the `/token` endpoint requires authentication. In this case, it is a Basic Auth digest of the client ID and secret. You can find the client ID and secret in your application's General tab. This requirement is why this call is only appropriate for applications that can guarantee the secrecy of the client secret. For more on Basic Auth, please see [Token Authentication Methods](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc/#token-authentication-methods).

Note the parameters that are being passed:

- `grant_type` is `authorization_code`, indicating that we are using the authorization code grant type.
- `redirect_uri` must match the URI that was used to get the authorization code.
- `code` is the authorization code that you got from the `/authorize` endpoint.

For more information on these parameters, see the [OAuth 2.0 API reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc/#token).

If the code is still valid, your application will receive back access and ID tokens:

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJhbG[...]9pDQ",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "scope": "openid",
    "id_token": "eyJhbG[...]RTM0A"
}
```

### 4. Next Steps

When your application passes a request with an `access_token`, the resource server will need to validate it. For more on this, see [Validating Access Tokens](/authentication-guide/tokens/validating-access-tokens).

### Examples

The following web application examples show you the authorization code flow, as it would be implemented by a web app that needs to authenticate the end user and then create a local session for that user. These projects use popular web frameworks to handle the heavy lifting. Each project can be cloned and ran locally.
